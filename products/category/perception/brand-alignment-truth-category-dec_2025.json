    "category_overview": "The moisturizer category is a crowded hospital waiting room. 15 brands are effectively roleplaying as the same dermatologist, reading from the same clinical script. Everyone is 'clinically proven,' 'dermatologist-recommended,' and 'fragrance-free.' The crowd fights for trust through white coats, safety through exclusion (free-from claims), and credibility through chemical diagrams. Nobody dares to be luxurious, mysterious, or truly playful. It is a beige brigade of Caregivers and Sages whispering the same promise of 'repair.'",
    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Democratic Infirmary",
      "description": "The category defines itself by pathology, not beauty. Authority is anchored in 'The Healer' (53%), where the goal is fixing broken skin barriers rather than enhancement. With 93% of brands positioning as 'Democratizers,' there is zero velvet rope—access is universal, and pricing is strictly masstige. The dominant value is 'Safety First' (87%), prioritizing the absence of irritation over the presence of pleasure."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Sterile Expert",
      "description": "The emotional temperature is near absolute zero. 'The Reliable Expert' (67%) dominates the personality, speaking with a 'Clinical Authority' tone (47%) that is dry, instructional, and grave. Visually, the shelf is a sea of 'Pharma-Code' (60%)—stark white bottles, navy blue text, and red medical crosses. It signals the sterility of a prescription product rather than the allure of a cosmetic."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "The Lab Report",
      "description": "Persuasion is purely rational. 'The Problem Solver' messaging (60%) hooks users with a diagnosis (eczema, dryness) and offers a mechanical fix. The narrative is almost exclusively 'The Lab Breakthrough' (73%), featuring faceless scientists and molecular diagrams. Validation comes from 'The Board' (67%)—dermatologists and seals of acceptance—rather than social proof or lifestyle aspiration."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Biological Maintenance",
      "description": "The promise is 'Restoration' (73%)—returning the skin to a non-painful baseline. Emotional benefits cluster around 'Relief' and 'Safety' (73%), offering the absence of anxiety rather than the presence of joy. Socially, purchasing is a 'Safe Choice' (93%)—an act of joining the herd to avoid risk. Self-expression is reduced to 'The Pragmatist' (73%), signaling rationality over taste."
