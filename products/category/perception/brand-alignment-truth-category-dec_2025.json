    "category_overview": "The moisturizer category is a sterile waiting room. 15 brands mostly sound like the same dermatologist reading from a textbook. Everyone is 'clinically proven,' 'dermatologist-recommended,' and obsessed with 'repairing' broken barriers. The crowd fights for trust through white coats, safety through 'fragrance-free' claims, and credibility through molecule names. Nobody dares to be dangerous, luxurious, or mysterious. It's a beige brigade of Caregivers and Sages whispering the same promises of restoration.",
    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Democratic Healer",
      "description": "The category derives authority from the Clinic/Lab (Marker 1: 60%), bypassing nature for white-coat validation. The mission is locked in Democratization (Marker 2: 93%), with nearly every brand promising accessible skin health for the masses. Values are heavily skewed toward Safety First (Marker 3: 87%), prioritizing 'hypoallergenic' tolerance over potency. Positioning is stuck in Medical Authority (Marker 4: 60%), with brands competing on who looks most like a prescription."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Sterile Caregiver",
      "description": "Emotionally, the category is distant and professional (Marker 5). The dominant archetype is The Caregiver (Marker 6: 53%), supported by The Sage's data. The voice is overwhelmingly Clinical Authority (Marker 7: 60%)—dry, instructive, and devoid of humor. Visually, 73% of brands adhere to Pharma-Code (Marker 8), utilizing white bottles, navy text, and grid layouts to signal safety."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "The Rational Chemist",
      "description": "Persuasion is driven by The Problem Solver logic (Marker 9: 53%), focusing on fixing deficits rather than fulfilling dreams. The Narrative is almost exclusively The Lab Breakthrough (Marker 10: 60%), citing anonymous dermatologists as heroes. Validation relies on The Board (Marker 11: 60%), where expert stamps outweigh user testimonials. USPs cluster around The Specialist (Marker 12: 53%), claiming ownership of specific pathologies like eczema or dryness."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Safety",
      "description": "Functionally, the category is a machine for Restoration (Marker 14: 73%), aiming to return skin to baseline rather than enhance it. Emotional benefits center on Relief/Safety (Marker 15: 73%), selling the absence of pain or worry. Socially, buying these products signals Pragmatism (Marker 16: 73%) and membership in The Safe Choice majority (Marker 17: 93%)."
