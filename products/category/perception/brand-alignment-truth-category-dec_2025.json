    "category_overview": "The moisturizer category is a photocopy machine of medical authority. 15 brands are fighting to wear the same white coat, with 100% clustering in the 'Democratizers' mission to make clinical skin health accessible to everyone. Everyone claims to be 'Dermatologist Recommended,' 'Clinically Proven,' and 'Fragrance-Free.' The crowd fights for trust through sterility and credibility through proprietary molecular complexes (TribioMa, MVE, Ceramides). Nobody dares to be exclusive, dangerous, or truly premium. It is a beige brigade of Caregivers and Sages whispering the same safety warnings.",

The dominant Purpose is 'The Healer' (60%), viewing skin as a damaged barrier that needs 'Restoration' rather than enhancement. Values are strictly 'Safety First' (80%), prioritizing hypoallergenic tolerance over aggressive performance."
