    "category_overview": "The moisturizer category is a sterile hospital corridor. 11 of 15 brands look and sound like dermatologists, wearing the same white coat and reciting the same clinical data. Everyone is 'clinically proven,' 'dermatologist-recommended,' and 'fragrance-free.' The crowd fights for trust through safety and authority through chemistry. Nobody dares to be dangerous, luxurious, or mysterious. It's a pragmatic brigade of Caregivers and Sages whispering about 'barrier repair' and 'lipid replenishment.'",
    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Democratic Healer",
      "description": "The category foundation is monolithic. 93% of brands position as Democratizers, ensuring universal access to skin health. The Purpose is locked in The Healer (60%), with brands sourcing authority from the lab to 'restore' and 'repair' broken skin. The value system is strictly Safety First (87%), prioritizing hypoallergenic tolerance over potency."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Sterile Expert",
      "description": "Emotionally, the category is cold and distant. 73% of brands use a 'Reliable Expert' personality, speaking with a Clinical Authority tone that is dry and instructional. The Visual Identity is dominated by Pharma-Code (73%)—white bottles, medical blue text, and grid layouts. The Archetype Mix is a fortress of Structure: Caregiver, Sage, and Ruler dominate the top three slots."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Rational Problem Solving",
      "description": "Persuasion is entirely rational. Messaging acts as The Problem Solver, hooking users with specific pathologies (eczema, dryness) rather than dreams. The Narrative is a Lab Breakthrough (60%), featuring faceless scientists rather than founders. Validation is hierarchical, relying on 'The Board' (Dermatologists) rather than user passion."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Safety",
      "description": "Functionally, the category is about Restoration (73%)—fixing a compromised barrier. The Emotional Benefit is Relief/Safety (73%), creating a sanctuary from pain or irritation. Socially, these are Tool purchases (The Pragmatist), signaling that the user makes safe, rational choices endorsed by The Majority."

    "headline": "The Archetypal Parent Trap",
    "gap_description": "The category is stifled by a monopoly of Structure. Marker 6 shows The Caregiver (53%), Sage (60%), and Ruler (47%) dominating every position. These are all Group A 'Stabilizer' archetypes. There is 0% presence of The Rebel, The Magician, or The Creator in dominant slots. The category treats consumers like children who need protection, never as adults who want freedom or transformation.",
    "evidence": "Archetypes Mix: Caregiver 53% / Sage 60% vs Rebel 0% / Magician 0%",
    "why_matters": "When every brand plays the 'Strict Parent' or 'Wise Teacher,' the emotional energy of the category flatlines. A brand that adopts a Group B (Freedom) or Group C (Ego) archetype—promising liberation from skin issues rather than just 'management'—would feel like a revolution.",
    "do_this_now": "Break the Caregiver code. Adopt The Magician (Transformation) or The Hero (Achievement). Instead of 'soothing' and 'managing' skin, promise to 'unlock' or 'conquer' it. Use language of power, not protection."

    "headline": "The Visual Sterile Ward",
    "gap_description": "Visual Identity is locked in a padded room of white and blue. 73% of brands occupy the Pharma-Code territory, using sterile grids and clinical palettes. Only 20% (Gen-Z Pop) offer any color. The 'Noir/Luxury' and 'Earthy/Raw' territories are virtually empty. The shelf looks like a hospital supply closet.",
    "evidence": "Visual Identity: Pharma-Code 73% vs Earthy Organic 7%",
    "why_matters": "Visual differentiation is the fastest way to hack the brain's attention. In a sea of white plastic bottles, a black, metallic, or raw-texture vessel signals 'Not Medicine' instantly. It allows a brand to charge a premium for 'beauty' rather than a commodity price for 'utility.'",
    "do_this_now": "Abandon the white bottle. Occupy the Earthy Organic territory (like Queen of the Thrones attempts) but execute with modern polish. Use amber glass, stone textures, or deep forest greens to signal 'Potent Nature' rather than 'Sterile Lab.'"

    "gap_description": "Narrative is dominated by The Lab Breakthrough (60%)—stories about molecules and faceless dermatologists. There is a complete absence of 'The Visionary' or 'The Rebel' founder stories. Consumers are buying chemistry, not philosophy. The category lacks a human face.",
    "evidence": "Narrative: Lab Breakthrough 60% vs Visionary Founder 0%",
    "why_matters": "People connect with people, not corporations. A Founder-led narrative that positions the creator as a guide who 'escaped' the medical industrial complex (The Personal Cure territory) builds a tribal loyalty that 'Galderma data' never can.",

    "evidence": "Functional Benefits: Restoration 73% vs Enhancement 7%",
    "why_matters": "Restoration is a grudge purchase; Enhancement is a desire purchase. Moving the functional promise from 'repair' to 'glow' or 'glass skin' shifts the price elasticity. Consumers pay more to look amazing than they do to stop itching.",
    "do_this_now": "Pivot the functional promise from 'Healing' to 'Optimizing.' Don't just repair the barrier; 'upgrade' the skin's infrastructure. Use language of performance (The Coach archetype) rather than medicine (The Doctor)."

    "evidence": "Values: Safety First 87% vs Clinical Efficacy 13%",
    "why_matters": "The 'Sensitive Skin' consensus has watered down the category. A segment of users wants 'Nuclear Option' efficacy—products that actually change skin texture overnight, even if they tingle. Owning 'High Performance' allows you to bypass the 'Hypoallergenic' race to the bottom.",
