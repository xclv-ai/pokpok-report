    "category_overview": "The moisturizer category is a crowded hospital corridor. 11 of 15 brands sound like the same dermatologist reading the same chart notes. Everyone is 'clinically proven,' 'dermatologist-recommended,' and 'fragrance-free.' The crowd fights for trust through white-coat authority and safety through hypoallergenic claims. Nobody dares to be dangerous, luxurious, or exclusive. It's a beige brigade of Caregivers and Sages whispering the same promises of repair.",
    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Democratic Healer",
      "description": "The category foundation is built on 'The Healer' (60%), with brands sourcing authority from the clinic to fix broken skin barriers. The Mission is overwhelmingly 'Democratic' (93%), with nearly every product positioning as an accessible essential for the masses. Values are locked in 'Safety First' (87%), where the fear of irritation trumps the promise of potency. It is a utility market, not an aspirational one."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "Sterile Experts",
      "description": "The emotional temperature is hospital-cold. 'The Reliable Expert' dominates Personality (73%), speaking with professional distance. The Archetype mix is a fortress of Structure (Group A), led by The Caregiver and The Sage. Visually, the category is a sea of 'Pharma-Code' (73%)—white bottles, navy text, and grid layouts that signal sterility rather than beauty."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Rational Problem Solving",
      "description": "Messaging is purely functional, with 'The Problem Solver' hook (53%) focusing on deficits like dryness and eczema. The Narrative is stuck in 'The Lab Breakthrough' (60%), celebrating molecules over founders. Brands rely on 'Dermatologist Validation' (60%) as the only currency of trust, ignoring social proof or lifestyle allure."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Biological Restoration",
      "description": "Functionally, the category is about 'Restoration' (73%)—returning skin to baseline rather than enhancing it. The Emotional Benefit is 'Relief/Safety' (73%), selling the absence of pain rather than the presence of joy. Socially, it is 'The Safe Choice' (93%), where buying the crowd favorite is the ultimate goal."
