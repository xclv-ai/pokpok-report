    "category_overview": "The moisturizer category is a crowded dermatology waiting room. 14 of 15 brands are wearing the same white coat, reading from the same medical chart. Everyone is 'clinically proven,' 'dermatologist recommended,' and obsessed with 'barrier repair.' The crowd fights for trust through sterility and safety through silence. Nobody dares to be loud, luxurious, or dangerous. It is a sterile brigade of Caregivers and Sages whispering about lipids and eczema.",
    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Democratic Infirmary",
      "description": "The category derives authority almost exclusively from the Clinic (60%), bypassing nature or lifestyle. The mission is mass-market Restoration—fixing broken skin barriers for everyone at a democratic price point (93% Democratizers). Value is defined by Safety First (87%), where 'Fragrance-Free' and 'Hypoallergenic' are the price of entry."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Sterile Expert",
      "description": "The emotional temperature is near zero. Brands position themselves as Distant Experts (73%), devoid of warmth or humor. The archetype mix is a fortress of Structure: Caregivers (Primary), Sages (Secondary), and Rulers (Tertiary) dominate. Visually, it is a sea of Pharma-Code—white bottles, blue text, and grid layouts (73%)."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Rational Diagnosis",
      "description": "Persuasion is purely Rational, hooking consumers with specific problems (Eczema, Dryness) rather than dreams. The dominant narrative is The Lab Breakthrough (60%), featuring faceless doctors and molecular diagrams. Validation is top-down: 'Dermatologist Recommended' (60%) is the only currency that matters."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Biological Relief",
      "description": "Functionally, the category is stuck in Restoration (73%)—fixing a negative state rather than enhancing a positive one. The primary emotional benefit is Relief/Safety (73%)—the cessation of pain or worry. Socially, these products are The Safe Choice (93%), purchased to blend in with the herd."
