    "category_overview": "The moisturizer category is a hospital waiting room. 15 brands posture as medical authorities, wearing the same white coat and reading the same chart. Everyone is 'dermatologist recommended,' 'clinically proven,' and 'fragrance-free.' The crowd fights for trust through sterility, framing skin not as a canvas for beauty but as a patient needing 'repair' and 'restoration.' Nobody dares to be dangerous, luxurious, or loud—except for the lone voices of eos and Jergens trying to inject dopamine into a sea of disinfectant.",

      "title": "The Democratic Healer",
      "description": "The category is locked in a mission of mass-market repair. Authority is derived from the Clinic (The Healer, 53%), with 93% of brands positioning as Democratizers—making medical-grade skin health accessible to everyone for under $20. The dominant value is 'Safety First' (87%), prioritizing hypoallergenic tolerance over high-performance transformation."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Caregiver's Uniform",
      "description": "Emotionally, the category is cool and distant. The dominant archetype is The Caregiver (53%), supported by The Sage (60%), creating a 'helpful expert' persona. The visual code is strictly Pharma-Code (60%)—white bottles, blue text, and grid layouts. The voice is Clinical Authority (53%), speaking in the dry, warning-filled language of a prescription label."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Problem-Solution Science",
      "description": "Persuasion is built on fear and relief. Messaging hooks on the Result (The Problem Solver, 60%) rather than the dream. The narrative is almost exclusively The Lab Breakthrough (67%), featuring faceless scientists rather than founders. Validation comes from The Board (67%)—dermatologists and eczema associations—rather than social proof or celebrity."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Biological Relief",
      "description": "Brands promise Restoration (67%)—returning skin to a healthy baseline—rather than aesthetic enhancement. The emotional payoff is Relief and Safety (73%), selling the absence of pain or itch. Socially, buying a moisturizer is The Safe Choice (93%), a pragmatic decision to join the herd and avoid risk."

    "why_matters": "In a sea of $15 commodities, a brand that demands $50+ and offers a 'ritual' rather than a 'routine' creates instant distinction. High-margin, low-volume cult brands thrive by being hard to get and hard to understand, exactly the opposite of the current category logic.",

    "why_matters": "Relief is fleeting; Empowerment is addictive. A brand that makes the user feel strong, capable, and ready to conquer the world (rather than just 'less itchy') taps into a higher-order emotional need that commands loyalty beyond the flare-up.",
