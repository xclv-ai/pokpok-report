      "why_matters": "This conflict confuses the customer's motivation. A shopper looking for a simple, no-fuss solution (WWW) may be put off by trend-based signaling (PDP), while a trend-conscious buyer may dismiss the brand as too utilitarian. You're trying to be two things to two different people.",
      "the_hard_choice": "You are either a humble utility tool or a celebrated cultural icon. The market data from Amazon suggests your bestseller status gives you permission to be the latter. Option A: Lean into the Amazon signal, update the website to celebrate its #1 status, and own the 'smart trend' narrative. Option B: Discipline the Amazon page, remove 'The Statement' signaling, and double down on being the quiet, reliable, pragmatic choice. You cannot be both the default and the declaration."

      "evidence": "[Narrative] WWW: 'The Ritual (Cultural)' vs. PDP: 'The Lab Breakthrough (Intellectual)'",
      "why_matters": "A brand's story is the foundation of its trust. By telling two different stories, you weaken both. The heritage story can feel dated when juxtaposed with lab claims, and the science can feel inauthentic when presented alongside nostalgia. This creates a crisis of origin.",
      "the_hard_choice": "The soul of your brand is either in its past or its test tubes, and you must choose which is the hero and which is the sidekick. Option A: Commit to the 'Lab Breakthrough' narrative globally, retiring the heritage story to focus on modern, derm-validated performance. Option B: Subordinate the 'derm' claims on Amazon to the primary narrative of a trusted American ritual, making science the proof, not the story. A brand cannot be both an heirloom and an invention."

      "evidence": "[Focus] WWW: 'Hard Product Sell (Transaction)' vs. PDP: 'Social Proof (Validation)'",
      "why_matters": "This suggests a divided strategy on what the customer needs to believe before they buy. The website assumes they are ready for a pitch, while the marketplace assumes they are a skeptic who needs proof. This inconsistency leads to a disjointed customer journey across channels.",
      "the_hard_choice": "You are telling customers two different things about their own state of mind, which means you don't have a clear theory of your customer. Option A: Adopt the Amazon strategy on your website, making social proof the hero of the page to build trust before asking for the sale. Option B: Remake the Amazon A+ content to be a more direct 'Hard Sell,' assuming the existing ratings are enough proof. You must decide if your customer is a skeptic who needs evidence or a shopper who needs a pitch."

      "evidence": "[Positioning] Value Slider: WWW 'Masstige (3/5)' vs. PDP 'Daily Essential (2/5)'",
      "why_matters": "This subtle drift erodes pricing power. If the market perceives you as a commodity staple (PDP), it becomes harder to justify the 'premium feel' of the brand (WWW) or any future price increases. You are one step away from being just another bulk buy.",
      "the_hard_choice": "Your brand lives on a knife's edge between being a special treat and a household commodity, and the market is pulling you toward commodity. Option A: Fortify the 'Masstige' position on Amazon with more elevated language and visuals to protect your pricing power. Option B: Concede that you are a 'Daily Essential' and adjust the website to align with a volume-over-margin strategy. A brand that feels premium but is priced as a staple will eventually be treated like a staple."

However, the PDP executes this with far more emotional resonance, using 'family-oriented' visuals and 'heart-shaped' motifs that make the brand feel more human than the more abstract, design-led website.",
      "evidence": "[Visual Identity] WWW focuses on color ('radiant blush-beige canvas') vs. PDP focuses on people ('Family-oriented and inviting visuals').",
      "why_matters": "Your marketplace presence is outperforming your brand home in emotional connection. The Amazon page proves the audience responds to explicit human warmth, yet your controlled environment (WWW) remains more reserved and aesthetically distant.",
      "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon page has discovered the brand's emotional core, and your own website is late to the party. Option A: Port the explicit human element—the families, the hearts, the smiles—from Amazon onto your website to create a consistent, emotionally resonant experience. Option B: Remove the human visuals from Amazon to maintain a more polished, design-led aesthetic, risking a colder, less engaging presence. The data from the market shows your customers respond to faces, not just feelings."
