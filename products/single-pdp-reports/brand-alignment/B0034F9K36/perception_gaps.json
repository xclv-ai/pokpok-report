    "evidence": "VALUES: WWW signals 'High-Performance (4/5)' from a proprietary 'Black Box (5/5)', while PDP signals 'Gentle (2/5)' with 'Explained (3/5)' science.",
    "why_matters": "This conflict erodes trust from both sides. Customers seeking a powerful fix will doubt the gentle PDP version, while safety-conscious buyers will be scared off by the aggressive WWW claims. This forces decision paralysis and pushes buyers to a competitor with a clear promise.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are caught between being a powerful treatment and a gentle comfort. The data demands a decision: Option A is to embrace the 'Safe Harbor' on your website, toning down the 'magic bullet' language to win the trust of the risk-averse mass market. Option B is to re-engineer the PDP to reflect 'Clinical Efficacy,' using A+ content to prove potency and justify a premium perception. You can't be a lion and a lamb at the same time."

    "why_matters": "You are splitting your audience. The customer seeking a medical-grade solution is alienated by the 'family' vibe on Amazon, and the parent looking for a gentle staple is intimidated by the clinical 'doctor' vibe on the website. This confusion weakens the brand's right to win in either context.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand is trying to sit in the doctor's office and the family living room simultaneously. The compromise is making you invisible in both. Option A: lean into the 'Gentle Giant' on the website, using lifestyle imagery to cement your role as a family staple. Option B: strip the warm visuals from Amazon and reinforce 'The Medical Authority' with clinical charts and derm quotes. A doctor gives a prescription; a parent gives a hug. They are not the same conversation."

    "evidence": "VISUALS: WWW uses a 'Cool (2/5)' visual temperature, signaling sterility. PDP uses a 'Radiating (4/5)' temperature, signaling approachability.",
    "why_matters": "Sensory dissonance breaks the brand promise before the user even reads a word. The user sees a 'lab' on one channel and a 'home' on the other, creating deep uncertainty about the product's origin, safety, and formulation. It looks like two entirely different products from two different companies.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your visual world is torn between the cold precision of a laboratory and the warm comfort of a home. You must decide on the soul of your aesthetic. Option A: adopt the warm, 'Earthy Organic' look on your website to match the higher-traffic marketplace and win on emotion. Option B: enforce the sterile 'Pharma-Code' on Amazon with stark white backgrounds and data-driven graphics to win on authority. You cannot sell a feeling of warmth with a cold-hearted design."

    "evidence": "ARCHETYPES: The tertiary archetype drifts from 'The Ruler' on WWW to 'The Everyman' on PDP.",
    "why_matters": "This drift reveals a strategic wobble in the source of your authority. Do you command respect through dominance and heritage, or do you earn trust through relatability and belonging? This crack in your brand's subconscious can widen over time, confusing whether your power comes from the boardroom or the neighborhood.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand's foundation is solid, but a quiet debate is happening in its soul: are you a king or a commoner? Option A: double down on 'The Ruler,' updating PDP content to reflect market leadership and heritage to command respect. Option B: embrace 'The Everyman' on your website, shifting the narrative from dominance to relatability and community trust. A king issues decrees from a throne; a neighbor offers advice over the fence. You must choose your court."

    "why_matters": "Your own website has become a conservative bottleneck, anchored in a clinical, problem-solving past. The PDP, which faces fierce competition daily, has learned that customers want to see aesthetic improvement, not just repair. This is a critical, underleveraged insight about audience motivation.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your direct channel is promising a cure, while your marketplace channel is promising an upgrade—and the upgrade is a more compelling sell. Option A: discipline the PDP, forcing it back to the narrow 'Micro-Correction' mission to maintain clinical purity. Option B: adopt the more ambitious 'Optimization' mission on your website, acknowledging that modern consumers want to thrive, not just survive. You can either be a hospital for skin or a health spa for it, and the spa is where the growth is."
