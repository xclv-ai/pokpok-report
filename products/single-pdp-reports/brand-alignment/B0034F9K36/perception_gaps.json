    "why_matters": "This forces the customer to decide what Jergens is: a tech company that makes lotions, or a skin-healing company that uses tech. This ambiguity weakens the authority of both claims and confuses the core reason to buy.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are caught between owning a technology and owning a problem. The market demands clarity. Option A: Re-orient the PDP to lead with the 'HYDRALUCENCE™' tech story, making the ingredient the hero.

    "evidence": "[Functional Benefits] WWW Action Vector: 'The Fixer (5/5)' vs. PDP Action Vector: 'The Healer (4/5)'",
    "why_matters": "This creates mismatched expectations. A customer seeking an intense treatment for cracked heels (WWW) may find the PDP promise too weak, while a customer wanting gentle, daily healing (PDP) may find the WWW promise too harsh.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are promising both a cosmetic repair and a biological cure, but these are different battles. Option A: Commit to the intense 'Fixer' narrative from the website across all channels, owning the heavy-duty repair niche. Option B: Adopt the gentler 'Healer' language from Amazon globally, positioning the brand as a safe, daily solution for systemic dryness. A battlefield medic and a family doctor carry different toolkits for a reason."

Option A: Commit to 'The Everyman' by amplifying the 'America's #1' story on Amazon. Option B: Commit to 'The Sage' by elevating 'Dermatologist Tested' claims to the forefront of the website.

    "why_matters": "This is a classic 'brand team vs. sales team' drift. While minor, this divergence suggests a lack of a central playbook, which, if unchecked, will lead to two distinct brand personalities over time, eroding the unified perception you've built.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand speaks two slightly different dialects of 'helpful.' This is a fragile peace. Option A: Inject the website's light, modern professionalism into the Amazon copy to feel more contemporary. Option B: Adopt the more conservative, traditional tone from Amazon across the board to double down on safety and authority.

    "why_matters": "The website is leaving emotional equity on the table. It has achieved the 'what' of its positioning but is missing the 'who for.' The Amazon page proves that adding a human, family-centric layer makes the 'Medical Authority' more powerful and resonant.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand is a Medical Authority everywhere, but your Amazon page has given it a soul. Option A: Strip the family-oriented creative from Amazon to maintain a purely functional, product-first positioning. Option B: Embrace the 'Family Healer' identity proven on the PDP and update the website to reflect this stronger, more emotionally compelling angle. A product can be a staple, but only a brand can be a tradition."
