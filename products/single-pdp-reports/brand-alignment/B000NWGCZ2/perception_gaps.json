    "the_hard_choice": "You must decide the nature of your utility. Option A: Align PDP to 'Maintenance' to capture the high-LTV 'worried well' audience, even if it lowers immediate conversion. Option B: Pivot WWW to 'The Healer' and position the brand exclusively for the 'Acute Sufferer' who needs urgent repair. You cannot be both a lifestyle shield and a trauma surgeon."

Option A: Adopt the 'Panic' tone globally, acknowledging that your core user is suffering and needs immediate relief.
