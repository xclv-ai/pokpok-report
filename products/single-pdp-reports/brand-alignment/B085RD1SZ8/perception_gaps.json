    "why_matters": "A customer can't trust both. Is your power inherent (Queen) or earned through data (Sage)? This schizophrenia forces the customer to choose which story to believe, weakening the authority of both claims and making the brand feel unstable.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are suffering from an identity crisis at the highest level: are you royalty or academia? The market demands a choice. Option A: Abdicate the throne on your website and embrace The Sage, reframing the 'Queen' as a symbol of wisdom, not just power. Option B: Fire the professor on Amazon, pulling back the academic language to assert the confident, regal authority of the brand. A queen who has to show her homework isn't a queen at all."

    "why_matters": "You are targeting two different customers. The user seeking emotional relief from anxiety is not the same person seeking intellectual validation for their shopping choices. This split focus dilutes the emotional hook and confuses what feeling the user is supposed to get from buying your product.",
    "the_hard_choice": "The brand is caught between providing comfort and providing validation. You must decide if you are in the business of soothing anxieties (Option A: Double down on 'Relief' and 'Sanctuary' messaging on Amazon) or in the business of empowering smart consumers (Option B: Evolve the website's promise from simple safety to intelligent choice). A sanctuary is where you go to feel safe; a smart choice is a trophy you display to feel proud."

    "why_matters": "This confuses the user's social motivation. Are they buying this to be seen as different from the mainstream, or to be accepted by a niche group of experts? The brand is sending conflicting signals about what tribe the customer is joining.",

Option A: Commit to the 'Knowledge Club' on your website, transforming the brand story to be about shared wisdom, not just individual virtue. Option B: Reinforce the 'Ethical Warrior' on Amazon, emphasizing the moral stand the purchase represents. You cannot be a humble club member and a proud protestor at the same time."

    "evidence": "Personality Thermostat Slider: WWW 'Pleasant' (3/5) vs. PDP 'Distant' (2/5).",
    "why_matters": "This is how brand personalities die: by a thousand small cuts. The Amazon team is likely interpreting 'expert' as 'cold and authoritative,' which could alienate customers who connected with the warmer, more approachable tone of the main site. Without correction, this drift will become a chasm.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your experts are showing up with two different personalities. The choice is stark: either codify the 'Pleasant' warmth as a global brand asset and retrain the Amazon team to adopt it (Option A), or embrace the colder, clinical authority on the website because it may be the high-converting reality of a competitive shelf (Option B). An expert can be a teacher or a judge, but trying to be both just makes you look confused."

    "why_matters": "Your main brand home is making a weaker case for your core value proposition than your Amazon page. A customer researching on both channels will find the Amazon page more trustworthy, devaluing the DTC site and making it feel like an afterthought.",

You face a critical decision: either immediately port the more robust list of proofs from Amazon to the website to create a consistent and powerful argument everywhere (Option A), or dilute the Amazon claims to match the simpler website, protecting consistency at the cost of conversion (Option B). When your sales channel makes a better case for your brand than you do, you have a serious strategic problem."
