    "description": "Embryolisse positions itself as the ultimate no-nonsense multitasker, bridging the gap between a dermatologist's clinic and a makeup artist's kit. It rejects 'miracle' marketing in favor of extreme utility ('6-in-1'), positioning itself as a pragmatic tool rather than a luxury indulgence. It feels like a trusted, smart secret that has become a democratic essential."

      "title": "The Safe Architect",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the medical clinic (Created in 1950 by a Dermatologist) while focusing on 'Maintenance' and 'Prep' rather than aggressive repair. It operates under a Safety First code, prioritizing tolerance and simplicity ('Short formula', 'Sensitive skin') over potency. It holds the Medical Authority slot, using clinical cues to signal reliability rather than prestige."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Caregiving Expert",
      "description": "The personality is that of a Reliable Expert—distanced but helpful, speaking with the precision of a pharmacist. The archetype mix is dominated by The Caregiver (60%), driven by safety and soothing claims, supported by The Sage's focus on smart, simplified ingredients. The Visual Identity is pure Pharma-Code: navy blue, white, and grid layouts that signal sterility and control."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Educational Problem Solver",
      "description": "The messaging acts as The Problem Solver, selling the functional versatility ('6-in-1') rather than a specific ingredient story. It relies on Derm-Validation and 'The Stat' (100% agreement) as proof, avoiding emotional fluff. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough story, grounded in a specific date (1950) and professional origin."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Pragmatic Correction",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Corrector/Primer, prepping the canvas for makeup while maintaining hydration. Emotionally, it delivers Confidence—the readiness to face the world (or the camera). Socially, it is The Safe Choice and The Pragmatist's badge, signaling intelligence and immunity to hype through its 'Smart Multi-Tasking' positioning."
