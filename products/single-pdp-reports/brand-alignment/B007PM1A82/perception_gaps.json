    "why_matters": "This disconnect confuses the value equation. If it's a medical tool, why does it feel good? If it's a beauty cream, why are you showing me charts? The customer doesn't know if they are buying pleasure or protection.",

The data demands a single functional truth: either pivot the entire brand to 'The Ultimate Primer' to own the makeup adjacency (Option A), or discipline the Amazon listing to focus on 'Derm-Skincare' to defend your medical heritage (Option B). A product that tries to be everything often ends up being nothing."

    "the_hard_choice": "Your DTC team is trying to be friends with the customer, but your brand equity is built on being a distant, authoritative doctor. You must decide: either warm up the Amazon listing to build a lifestyle brand (Option A), or cool down the website to 'Clinical Zero' to reinforce the medical mystique (Option B).

Efficiency is the one language everyone speaks."
