      "title": "Democratic Clinical Safety",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in a 1950s hospital origin (Purpose: The Healer) but directs that power toward universal accessibility rather than exclusion.

The narrative is a classic Lab Breakthrough, leveraging its dermatological birthright to validate its cult status."

The emotional payoff is Relief/Safety—the comfort of a product that 'never fails.' Socially, it acts as The Knowledge Club, signaling that the user is an 'insider' who knows the secrets of French pharmacists and makeup pros."
