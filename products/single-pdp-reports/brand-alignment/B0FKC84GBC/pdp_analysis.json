    "description": "Jergens successfully hijacks fidget-toy neurology to turn hydration into a tactile playground. By wrapping the heritage safety of a 125-year-old clinical brand in Gen-Z 'squish' mechanics, they create a 'Safe Risk'—parents buy the dermatologist testing; teens keep the dopamine. It positions itself not as skincare, but as entertainment that happens to moisturize."
