    "gap_description": "The brand's website signals that it's a safe, protective 'Guardian' of skin health. The Amazon page signals it's a fun, psychological 'Empowerer' that makes a routine joyful. One is about preventing harm, the other is about adding pleasure.",
    "evidence": "[Purpose] WWW: 'The Guardian (SCIENTIFIC PROTECTION)' vs. PDP: 'The Empowerer (Psychological Uplift)'",
    "why_matters": "This confuses the core reason for buying. Is this a sensible health purchase or an emotional treat? This conflict weakens both the trust signal and the fun signal, leaving the brand in a confusing middle ground.",
    "the_hard_choice": "The brand's soul is split between the lab coat and the candy store. The data demands a decision: Option A: Double down on the fun, rewriting the website to embrace the 'Empowerer' role and admitting skincare can be entertainment. Option B: Discipline the Amazon page, stripping the 'psychological uplift' language to recenter on the 'Guardian' promise of safe, trusted care. You can't be a doctor and a DJ at the same time."

    "headline": "Scent vs. Squish",
    "gap_description": "The website claims the brand's unique advantage is its nostalgic 'iconic Cherry Almond scent.' The Amazon page claims the advantage is the novel 'squishy burst' delivery system. You're selling heritage on one channel and innovation on the other.",
    "evidence": "[USP] WWW: 'The Ingredient King' (Hero Ingredient) vs. PDP: 'The Specialist' (Delivery Innovation)",
    "why_matters": "This fractures the innovation story. Is the brand leaning on the past (scent) or inventing the future (format)? A confused Unique Selling Proposition is, by definition, not unique and fails to build a competitive moat.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You have to decide if the hero of your story is the potion or the bottle. Option A: Commit to the format; update the website to lead with the 'Specialist' innovation of the squishy burst, framing the scent as a feature, not the core USP. Option B: Re-anchor the Amazon page to the 'Ingredient King' story, positioning the format as a new way to experience the iconic scent. A brand that doesn't know what makes it special will be treated as generic."

    "evidence": "[Self-Expression] WWW: 'The Trend-Setter (Relevance)' vs. PDP: 'The Pragmatist (Rationality)'",
    "why_matters": "The customer doesn't know who they become after purchase. Are they the cool kid with the new toy, or the savvy shopper who found a good deal? This confusion kills the post-purchase social signaling value of the product.",
    "the_hard_choice": "The brand is caught between being a fashion accessory and a hardware store tool. You must choose: Option A: Embrace being a Pragmatist, rewriting the website to focus on the clever utility of the product for gifting and travel. Option B: Commit to being a Trend-Setter, removing the utility language from Amazon to lean into the identity-signal of being playful and modern. You have to choose whether you are selling a vibe or a solution."

    "gap_description": "Both channels use a 'Gen-Z Pop' visual style, but the Amazon version is significantly louder, with a 'Hot' (5/5) energy versus the website's softer 'Radiating' (4/5) warmth. The controlled brand home is being outperformed by its aggressive marketplace evolution.",
    "evidence": "Visual Thermostat Slider: WWW 4/5 (Radiating) vs. PDP 5/5 (Hot)",
    "why_matters": "This subtle drift suggests the Amazon team is pushing the brand's visual identity to its limit without clear guardrails. While still aligned, this 'volume creep' could easily devolve into a cheap, off-brand look, eroding the trust the parent brand provides.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon presence is getting results by turning up the volume, but it's drifting from the core brand's aesthetic. Option A: Rein in the marketplace team, creating stricter visual guidelines to pull the PDP back to a 'Radiating' warmth to protect long-term brand equity. Option B: Acknowledge that the market rewards heat; update the global brand guidelines to a 'Hot' aesthetic, accepting this will accelerate the departure from the brand's gentle heritage. Consistency feels boring until inconsistency makes you look cheap."

    "evidence": "Emotional Language: PDP ('undeniably adorable', 'love at first squish') > WWW ('fun moisturizer moment')",
    "why_matters": "Your controlled environment (WWW) is the bottleneck for your brand's emotional potential. The marketplace, where you must compete for attention, has proven that a bolder, more effusive promise resonates with customers.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon copywriter is outperforming your brand site's voice, proving the customer is ready for more passion. Option A: Mute the Amazon page, forcing it back to the more reserved corporate language to maintain a single, safe voice. Option B: Promote the Amazon voice to the global standard, updating the website to reflect the bolder, more confident emotional promise that is clearly winning in the wild. You can't lead a tribe by whispering."
