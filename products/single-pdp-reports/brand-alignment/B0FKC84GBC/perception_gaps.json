You face a strategic ultimatum: either downgrade the 'Bursts' to a mere delivery vehicle for the Hero Scent (Option A), or elevate the 'Bursts' to be the defining IP of the new Jergens era, rendering the scent secondary (Option B).

You must choose: either strip the defensive claims to let the 'Jester' personality breathe and maximize desire (Option A), or standardize the 'Clinical Safety' messaging globally to reassure parents, even if it kills the vibe (Option B).
