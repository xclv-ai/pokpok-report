However, the strategy lags behind the execution: the Website clings to 'Heritage Rituals' and 'Gentle Giant' safety, while Amazon embraces 'Lab Tech' and 'Clean Essentialist' hype, creating a conflict between the brand's past and its product's future."

    "why_matters": "Heritage implies safety, but also boredom. For a 'Fun' product, the heavy reliance on history on the WWW acts as a drag on the excitement.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your website is looking backward to justify the product's existence, while your Amazon listing is looking forward to sell the experience. The heritage story feels heavy attached to such a lighthearted product.

    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon copywriter is getting laughs and clicks by screaming, but they are writing checks your medical authority can't cash. The 'Class Clown' energy is high, but it risks eroding the 'Derm Tested' trust. You face a choice: either muzzle the Amazon voice to ensure you look like a doctor (Option A), or loosen the tie on the website and accept that Jergens is now officially a 'Hype' brand (Option B)."
