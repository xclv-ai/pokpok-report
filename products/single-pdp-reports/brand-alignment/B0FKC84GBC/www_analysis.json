    "description": "Jergens hijacks fidget-toy neurology to turn hydration into a dopamine hit. The squishy burst mechanism isn't a feature—it's a permission structure that says 'Skincare can be fun,' solving the teen skincare paradox: parents want the safety of a 125-year-old heritage brand, while teens want the viral 'squish.' It successfully bridges The Guardian territory (safety) with Gen-Z Pop aesthetics."
