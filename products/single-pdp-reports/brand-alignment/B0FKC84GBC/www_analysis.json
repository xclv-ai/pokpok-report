    "headline": "The Viral Sensory Snack",
    "description": "Jergens hijacks the fidget-toy neurology of Gen-Z to turn hydration into a dopamine hit. By encasing a 125-year-old heritage scent in a viral 'squishy' format, they successfully bridge the gap between 'Clinical Safety' (Mom buys it) and 'Sensory Play' (Teen wants it). It feels less like a skincare routine and more like a permissible treat."

      "title": "Intelligent Indulgence",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a standard Hydrator (Marker 14), but the payoff is 'Intelligence'—the savvy of finding the coolest gift (Marker 15). It acts as a 'Trend-Setter' badge (Marker 16), allowing the owner to signal relevance while remaining a 'Safe Choice' (Marker 17) within the mass market."
