    "description": "Jergens executes a brilliant 'Trojan Horse' strategy: wrapping 125 years of clinical trust inside a Gen-Z fidget toy. It democratizes the 'viral skincare' trend by making it safe (Dermatologist Tested), affordable ($7.99), and accessible. It’s no longer just a lotion; it’s a dopamine-triggering 'squish' that bridges the gap between a grandmother’s trusted brand and a teenager’s TikTok feed."

It focuses on Lifestyle Aesthetic, turning a commodity moisturizer into an editorial 'moment.'"
