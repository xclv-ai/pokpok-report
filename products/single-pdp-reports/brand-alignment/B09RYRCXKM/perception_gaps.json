    "gap_description": "Your strategic USP focuses on the hero ingredient ('The Hero': Petrolatum), but the product page wisely pivots to the proprietary mechanism ('The Tech': semi-occlusive barrier). While both are factually correct, you are communicating two different sources of uniqueness, diluting your competitive edge.",
    "evidence": "[USP] Strategy: Ownership of 'The Hero' ingredient (2/5) vs. Reality: Ownership of 'The Tech' mechanism (4/5)",
    "why_matters": "Owning a commodity ingredient like Petrolatum is difficult and low-margin. Owning a unique scientific mechanism ('a barrier that lets skin breathe') is a powerful, defensible moat that builds scientific authority and justifies brand preference. The PDP execution is stronger than the strategy, but the inconsistency weakens the claim.",
    "do_this_now": "Unify the USP around 'The Tech.' Update the core brand website and all marketing materials to lead with the 'intelligent semi-occlusive barrier' story, relegating the ingredient to a supporting role. Own the 'how,' not just the 'what.'"

    "truth_type": "gap",
    "headline": "From Lab Report to Doctor's Explanation",
    "gap_description": "The brand's core strategy is to persuade with 'Raw Data'—cold, hard facts like 'Petrolatum (30%)'. The product page evolves this into a more effective 'Rational' argument, explaining the logical cause-and-effect of how the formula works. This is a subtle shift from stating a fact to making a case.",
    "evidence": "[MESSAGING] Strategy: Persuasion Logic is 'Raw Data' (1/5) vs. Reality: Persuasion Logic is 'Rational' (2/5)",
    "why_matters": "Raw data impresses experts but can be meaningless to consumers. A rational explanation converts them by connecting a feature to a benefit. While the drift is positive, it signals a potential disconnect between what the brand team values (clinical proof) and what the sales team needs (a compelling argument).",
    "do_this_now": "Update the core messaging guidelines to officially adopt the 'Rational' persuasion model. Mandate that every data point or ingredient percentage must be followed by a 'which means...' or 'so that...' clause to translate the lab report into a tangible user benefit."

    "gap_description": "Your brand personality aims for the absolute, unquestionable authority of 'The Deity.' On the product page, this softens to the more approachable and trust-building authority of 'The Specialist.' You are moving from a stone tablet of commandments to a doctor's expert consultation.",
    "evidence": "[PERSONALITY] Strategy: Power Dynamic is 'The Deity' (5/5) vs. Reality: Power Dynamic is 'The Specialist' (4/5)",
    "why_matters": "While 'Deity' status is powerful, it creates distance and can feel archaic. 'Specialist' status fosters more trust and connection in modern e-commerce. This is a beneficial drift, but because it's unmanaged, it risks sliding further into a generic 'Friendly Peer' persona, which would completely erode your clinical authority.",
    "do_this_now": "Formally revise the brand personality guidelines to define the power dynamic as 'The #1 Specialist.' This codifies the successful adaptation on the PDP and creates a clear guardrail to prevent further dilution of your authoritative stance."

    "gap_description": "Your Personality alignment is a healthy 90%. However, the 'Robotic' emotional thermostat (1/5) is consistently maxed out on coldness. The only thing currently saving the brand from feeling like a cold, unfeeling corporation is the humanizing 'Specialist' power dynamic.",
    "evidence": "[PERSONALITY] Alignment: 90% | Risk: 'Robotic' slider at 1/5 with no warmth to balance it.",
    "why_matters": "A new agency or campaign could easily misinterpret 'clinical' as 'corporate and cold.' If the 'Specialist' nuance is lost and only 'Robotic' remains, you become a vending machine for skin paste. This makes you vulnerable to warmer, more empathetic challenger brands who can steal your market share by building a stronger emotional connection.",
    "do_this_now": "Add a specific guardrail to the brand style guide: 'Our authority comes from expertise, not coldness. Always frame data with a human touch, like \"Dermatologists recommend...\" to reinforce the expert, not the corporate, voice.'"

    "evidence": "[POSITIONING] Alignment: 100% | Opportunity: 'Daily Essential' (2/5) has room to evolve.",
    "why_matters": "You have earned the right to transition from being an essential utility to being the 'standard of care.' This elevates the brand from a reactive purchase ('I have chapped lips') to a proactive, foundational part of a health routine ('This is what smart people use to maintain skin barrier health'). This shift dramatically expands your use case and market size.",
