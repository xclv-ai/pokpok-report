    "headline": "Ingredient vs. Mechanism",
    "gap_description": "The brand's Unique Selling Proposition is split. The WWW claims ownership of 'The Hero' ingredient (Petrolatum), while the PDP claims ownership of 'The Tech' (the semi-occlusive barrier). This is a core strategic contradiction about what makes the product unique.",
    "evidence": "[USP] WWW Ownership: 'The Hero' (2/5) vs. PDP Ownership: 'The Tech' (4/5)",
    "why_matters": "A confused USP weakens the entire competitive argument. A potential customer is left unsure if the magic is in the ingredient list or in the scientific process. This indecision can cause them to default to a competitor with a simpler, more singular claim.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are telling two different stories about why you win. The data demands you pick one hero for the brand narrative. Option A: Rewrite the PDP to champion Petrolatum as the sole protagonist, simplifying the story for a mass audience. Option B: Elevate the 'semi-occlusive barrier' technology story on the WWW, committing to a more sophisticated, science-led differentiation. A brand cannot own two USPs; a singular focus is the price of being memorable."

  "truth_2": {
    "truth_type": "gap",
    "headline": "Data vs. Logic",
    "gap_description": "The persuasion logic shifts subtly between channels. WWW uses 'Raw Data' (clinically proven, #1 recommended), assuming authority is enough. PDP uses a 'Rational' argument, explaining *how* the barrier works. It's a shift from 'what' to 'why'.",
    "evidence": "[Messaging Persuasion] WWW: 'Raw Data' (1/5) vs. PDP: 'Rational' (2/5)",
    "why_matters": "This nuance targets different mindsets. 'Raw Data' appeals to a customer who trusts credentials unquestioningly. 'Rational' appeals to a skeptic who needs to understand the mechanism. By using both, you risk not fully satisfying either audience.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your website is a lab report, while your product page is a science lesson. You must decide if your customer wants proof or understanding. Option A: Fortify the PDP with more raw data points, committing to the strategy of winning through overwhelming authority. Option B: Evolve the WWW to include the rational 'how it works' explanation, betting that a more educated customer is a more loyal one. You must choose whether to be a dictionary or an encyclopedia."

  "truth_3": {
    "truth_type": "gap",
    "headline": "Deity vs. Specialist",
    "gap_description": "The brand's power dynamic changes slightly. On its WWW, it is 'The Deity' (5/5) — an unquestionable, final authority. On the PDP, it softens to 'The Specialist' (4/5) — a highly educated expert offering a diagnosis. It's the difference between a decree and a recommendation.",
    "evidence": "[Personality Power Dynamic] WWW: 'The Deity' (5/5) vs. PDP: 'The Specialist' (4/5)",
    "why_matters": "This slight tonal shift alters the customer relationship. 'Deity' status creates distance and demands faith, while 'Specialist' status invites trust and collaboration. The inconsistency can make the brand feel aloof on its home turf compared to its more approachable marketplace persona.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand speaks from a throne on its website but from a lab coat on its product page. This dual posture erodes the consistency of its authority. Option A: Elevate the PDP's authority to match the 'Deity' status of the WWW, enforcing a single, top-down power dynamic. Option B: Soften the WWW's authoritative stance to match the more collaborative 'Specialist' role, making the entire brand more approachable. You must decide if you want to be worshipped from afar or trusted up close."

    "truth_type": "hidden_risk",
    "headline": "Ruler vs. Hero",
    "gap_description": "Though highly aligned, the brand's tertiary archetype drifts from 'The Ruler' on WWW (power from market dominance) to 'The Hero' on PDP (power from rescuing skin in crisis). This reveals a subtle, internal disagreement on the brand's source of power.",
    "evidence": "[Archetypes Mix] WWW Tertiary: 'The Ruler' vs. PDP Tertiary: 'The Hero'",
    "why_matters": "This is a hidden risk because it shows that different teams are interpreting the brand's soul differently. Is power derived from status (#1 in the market) or from action (providing 'SOS care')? This fissure, while small, could widen over time and lead to inconsistent campaign messaging.",
    "the_hard_choice": "The brand's quietest voice is telling two different stories about its power. You must codify its true motivation. Option A: Commit to The Ruler archetype across all channels, focusing all messaging on market leadership and #1 status as the ultimate proof point. Option B: Embrace The Hero archetype globally, reframing the narrative around the brand's ability to rescue customers from painful skin emergencies. A brand can be a king or a knight, but trying to be both creates a confused sovereign."

    "headline": "The 'Unapologetic' Edge",
    "gap_description": "Positioning is perfectly aligned at 100%, but the language used to describe the PDP execution is bolder ('Unapologetic Clinical') than the WWW's ('Hard Clinical'). The marketplace has developed a more confident and assertive voice for the brand.",
    "evidence": "Positioning is 100% aligned, but the PDP's qualitative descriptor is stronger.",
    "why_matters": "Your own website is the most conservative expression of your brand. The PDP, operating in a fiercely competitive environment, has evolved a sharper, more confident edge that is likely resonating with consumers. This strength is currently siloed on the product page.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand identity is consistent, but your marketplace voice has more swagger—and swagger sells. You are underselling your own authority on your website. Option A: Maintain the more reserved, 'Hard Clinical' tone on the WWW to keep it as a formal, corporate anchor. Option B: Adopt the 'Unapologetic Clinical' mindset globally, injecting that potent confidence into your website to show you're not just clinical by necessity, but proud of it. In a crowded market, humility is a liability."
