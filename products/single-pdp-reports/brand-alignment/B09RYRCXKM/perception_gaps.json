    "why_matters": "This split personality forces the customer to switch their brain from 'analytical' on the website to 'emotional' on Amazon. This confuses the core value proposition: are you buying a molecule or a feeling of relief? The brand loses authority by not having a single, clear answer.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are caught between telling the customer how the watch is made and simply telling them the time. The data demands a choice. Option A: Commit to the sophisticated, ingredient-led story of 'The Chemist' on Amazon, trusting customers to value the science. Option B: Surrender to the conversion-optimized language of 'The Problem-Solver' and rewrite your website to lead with benefits. You cannot be both the lab report and the cure."

    "why_matters": "The brand is hedging its bets between two opposing definitions of 'safety.' One is legacy medical authority ('trust the doctor'); the other is the modern wellness movement ('trust the ingredients list'). This schizophrenia makes the brand look uncertain of its own authority.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are trying to win the trust of two different generations simultaneously. This is impossible. Option A: Go all-in on your medical heritage, stripping the 'free-from' language from Amazon to signal that you are a clinical solution, not a wellness trend. Option B: Modernize your website to lead with 'Formula Purity,' acknowledging that the definition of 'safe' has changed for today's consumer.

    "the_hard_choice": "This isn't a crisis, but a critical fine-tuning opportunity. Your brand is telling its story in two slightly different dialects. Option A: Double down on the 'Explained' narrative, using more storytelling on Amazon to build a richer context around the product's function. Option B: Adopt the spartan 'Evidence-First' approach from Amazon on your website, rebuilding trust through raw data and charts. An explanation is a story, but evidence is a verdict.

    "evidence": "[USP - Ownership Slider] WWW: 'The Tech' (4/5) vs. PDP: 'The System' (5/5)",
    "why_matters": "Your Amazon presence is creating a bigger, more authoritative vision for the brand than your own website is. This makes the DTC site look outdated and conservative, underselling the full value of the Aquaphor ecosystem. The marketplace is out-innovating the brand home.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon team has built a bigger empire for you than your own capital city, creating a fragile strength. Option A: Force the PDP back to the more focused 'Tech' story to maintain perfect consistency, even if it means sacrificing a bigger vision.

    "the_hard_choice": "The market data from your most competitive channel is clear: customers want more expert, less helper. Option A: Dilute the 'Sage' voice on Amazon to match the softer, more nurturing tone of the website, prioritizing internal consistency over market feedback. Option B: Listen to the market, amplify the 'Sage' archetype on your website, and globally codify the brand as a more assertive, knowledgeable expert. The market is voting for the brilliant doctor over the comforting nurse."
