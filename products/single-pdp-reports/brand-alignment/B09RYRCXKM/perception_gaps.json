    "evidence": "[VALUES] WWW: 'Radical Transparency (Aggressive)' vs. PDP: 'Safety First (Hypoallergenic)'",
    "why_matters": "This conflict confuses the core promise. Is Aquaphor an aggressive, high-performance product for users who read spec sheets, or a gentle, safe harbor for those with sensitive skin? You are attracting two different audiences with two conflicting promises, which erodes trust for both.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are either a chemical weapon or a first aid kit. The market demands you choose which promise to keep. Option A: Lean into the 'Radical Transparency' on Amazon, showcasing clinical power to win over discerning experts. Option B: Soften the website's technical jargon to align with the 'Safety First' promise, capturing the larger mass market that fears irritation. You cannot be both the scalpel and the bandage."

    "gap_description": "Your WWW presence is dominated by The Sage archetype (70%), acting as a detached professor presenting data. Your PDP presence is dominated by The Caregiver (70%), acting as a nurturing nurse focused on protection and soothing. The brand's core motivation is schizophrenic.",
    "evidence": "[ARCHETYPES] WWW: Primary Sage (Truth-seeker) vs. PDP: Primary Caregiver (Nurturer)",
    "why_matters": "This changes the entire customer relationship. A user seeking clinical facts on Amazon receives empathetic reassurance, while a user seeking comfort on your website gets a science lecture. This emotional dissonance makes the brand feel unpredictable and hollow.",
    "the_hard_choice": "The brand has a split soul: is your purpose to educate or to comfort? Option A: Re-engineer the PDP to reflect the cold, hard data of The Sage, appealing to rationalists who value truth over comfort. Option B: Overhaul the website with a warmer, more empathetic tone to align with The Caregiver, winning hearts instead of just minds. A brand that tries to be both the head and the heart ends up connecting with neither."

    "gap_description": "A subtle but important power dynamic is inconsistent. The WWW projects the personality of a 'Deity' (5/5 Unquestionable Authority), speaking from a remote, infallible position. The PDP softens this to 'The Specialist' (4/5 Highly Educated), an expert who is more grounded and approachable.",
    "evidence": "[PERSONALITY] Authority Slider: WWW 5/5 ('The Deity') vs. PDP 4/5 ('The Specialist')",
    "why_matters": "This inconsistency affects how customers relate to the brand. The 'Deity' can feel arrogant and dated, while 'The Specialist' feels modern and trustworthy. Switching between these stances makes the brand's authority feel unstable—is it absolute or is it earned?",
    "the_hard_choice": "The ivory tower is an outdated concept. You must decide if you are broadcasting from the heavens or consulting from the clinic. Option A: Reassert the brand's absolute 'Deity' authority on Amazon to command premium respect and maintain its legacy. Option B: Bring the website down to earth and adopt the more modern 'Specialist' persona globally, fostering trust instead of obedience. Authority today is earned in conversation, not declared by decree."

    "evidence": "[TONE OF VOICE] Respect Slider: WWW 2/5 ('Respectful') vs. PDP 3/5 ('Neutral')",
    "why_matters": "This signals a potential split in brand governance. The PDP team is likely evolving the voice to be more direct for a competitive marketplace, while the WWW team holds to a traditional corporate standard. This tiny crack is where brand schizophrenia begins, and it will widen over time if not addressed.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand is developing an accent depending on where it speaks. Do you enforce one global dialect or let regional variations emerge? Option A: Mandate the more formal, 'Respectful' tone across all channels to preserve legacy consistency. Option B: Adopt the direct 'Neutral' tone from the PDP as the new global standard, acknowledging that the market now values clarity over courtesy. A brand with two voices is just whispering to itself."

    "evidence": "[POSITIONING] PDP context frames the 100% aligned position as a tool for an 'active life', while WWW frames it as a 'cure'.",
    "why_matters": "The brand's own website is underselling the product's role in a customer's life. It's stuck in the medicine cabinet. The marketplace has proven the brand can live in the gym bag, expanding its use case and market relevance far beyond just fixing skin problems.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon page has discovered your product's secret life. The market sees it as a versatile tool, not just a treatment. Option A: Force the Amazon page to strip away the lifestyle context, doubling down on the purely clinical identity to maintain a narrow focus. Option B: Embrace this market-proven evolution and rewrite the website to position the brand as a versatile life-utility tool. You have to decide if you are selling a medicine or a superpower."
