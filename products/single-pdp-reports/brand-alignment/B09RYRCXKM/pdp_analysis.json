    "description": "Aquaphor feels less like a skincare brand and more like a piece of medical equipment you can buy on Amazon. It completely rejects beauty aesthetics to project an aura of pure, clinical utility. It plays the role of the on-call dermatologist, offering immediate, no-nonsense relief for painful skin problems, not a sensory experience."

      "description": "The brand's purpose is to be a Healer, anchoring its authority firmly in the clinic with a Derm-Validated stance to fix skin problems.

      "description": "There is a significant and deliberate distance between the brand and user; it communicates like a specialist, not a friend. Dominated by a mix of The Caregiver (60%) and The Sage (25%), its identity as a Reliable Expert is absolute. This is reinforced by a sterile, Pharma-Code visual system and a Clinical Authority tone of voice that is factual, serious, and devoid of emotion."

      "description": "Messaging is built to be a Problem Solver, hooking the user with a specific pain point and offering a rational fix. Its USP is being The Specialist for chafed and cracked skin, validated by the KSP of Derm-Validation. The narrative is a classic Lab Breakthrough, and the page's focus is on Science Education, using facts and diagrams to prove its case."
