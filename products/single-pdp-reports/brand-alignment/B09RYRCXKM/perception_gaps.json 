The Brand Strategy defines a sensory, dopamine-driven beauty brand (eos), but the Digital Shelf executes a sterile, clinical first-aid product (Aquaphor). You are not just missing the mark; you are selling an entirely different category.",

    "narrative": "To a stranger on Amazon, this brand presents as a stoic, medical necessity found in the pharmacy aisle, not a beauty ritual. The dominance of 'Safety Warnings,' 'Petrolatum,' and 'Skin Protectant' claims strips away all joy and aspiration. The consumer feels they are buying a tool to fix a problem (chafing/cracking), not a treat to elevate their mood.",

      "gap_description": "Your Website aims to be 'The Empowerer' using 'Gen-Z Pop' codes to trigger dopamine (Strategy). However, the PDP executes 'The Guardian' using 'Pharma-Code' visuals (Reality). You have surgically removed the personality to focus on pathology.",
      "evidence": "[TERRITORY] Strategy: 'The Alchemist (Joy/Dopamine)' vs. Reality: 'The Guardian (Scientific Protection)'",
      "why_matters": "You are trading high-margin emotional loyalty for low-margin utilitarian necessity. Customers buy 'Joy' because they want to; they buy 'Protection' only when they have to.",
      "do_this_now": "Scrub the medical hierarchy immediately. Replace the 'Skin Protectant/Drug Facts' visual logic with the 'Whipped Texture' imagery from the strategy. Leading with 'Petrolatum' kills the 'Vanilla Cashmere' dream instantly."

      "headline": "Sensory Erasure",
      "gap_description": "Your strategy relies entirely on the 'Lover' archetype, promising 'nuzzle-worthy' scents and 'whipped' textures. The PDP explicitly markets 'Fragrance Free' and 'Invisible' application. You are effectively selling the *absence* of the very experience you claim is your core differentiator.",
      "evidence": "[SENSORY PAYOFF] Strategy: 'Whipped vanilla, soft musk (Indulgence)' vs. Reality: 'Fragrance Free / Non-sticky (Erasure)'",
      "why_matters": "This is a direct contradiction that breaks trust. If a user expects 'Vanilla Cashmere' and reads 'Fragrance Free,' they will bounce immediately, assuming they found the wrong product.",
      "do_this_now": "Align the PDP inventory or description. If this is the scented SKU, the 'Fragrance Free' claim must be deleted and replaced with a 'Fragrance Profile' graphic (Top/Mid/Base notes) to restore the sensory hook."

      "why_matters": "Visuals process 60,000x faster than text. Before the customer reads a word, your colors tell them 'This is medicine.' You are invisible to the beauty shopper and only relevant to the injured shopper.",

      "gap_description": "You aim to be the 'Best Friend' (Jester/Everyman) who hypes you up. The PDP speaks like a 'Doctor' (Caregiver/Ruler) giving discharge instructions. The tone shift from 'Awesome skin > dry skin' to 'Stop use if condition worsens' creates emotional whiplash.",
      "evidence": "[TONE] Strategy: 'Hype Beast (Enthusiastic)' vs. Reality: 'Instruction Manual (Stoic/Warning)'",
      "why_matters": "A 'Best Friend' builds community; a 'Doctor' builds distance. You are failing to build the 'Tribe' aimed for in the strategy because the PDP language is too authoritative and cold to encourage connection.",

      "headline": "The Commodity Trap",
      "gap_description": "Your strategy is 'Masstige'—using 'Vanilla Cashmere' naming to signal premium status at a low price. The PDP reverts to 'Commodity'—focusing on price ($7.86) and generic ingredients (Petrolatum) without the lifestyle wrapper.",
