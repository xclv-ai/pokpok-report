    "description": "CeraVe executes a flawless Medical Authority strategy, positioning itself not as a beauty product but as a biological necessity. By anchoring entirely in 'Dermatologist Developed' credibility and the '3 Essential Ceramides' narrative, it democratizes clinical skin science (MVE Technology) for the mass market. It feels like a prescription without the co-pay—safe, effective, and stripped of all vanity."

The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, citing mechanism diagrams ('10 surface layers deep') rather than origin stories. KSPs rely entirely on Derm-Validation, using the board certification as the ultimate proof."
