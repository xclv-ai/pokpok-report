    "evidence": "WWW: 'Dermatologist-tested' (Validator: 2/5) vs. PDP: '52,931 global ratings' (Validator: 5/5)",
    "why_matters": "Science is cold; popularity is warm. By splitting the validation source, you fail to consolidate trust. The user doesn't know if they are buying a medical prescription or a viral trend.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are caught between two sources of truth. The data demands a decision: either double down on the 'Dermatologist' credential to maintain premium authority (Option A), or surrender to the wisdom of the crowd and brand yourself as 'The People's Choice' (Option B). You cannot be both an elite clinic and a populist movement."

    "the_hard_choice": "Your pricing strategy on Amazon is actively eroding your brand equity on your own site. You face a binary choice: either enforce price parity to protect the 'Expert' aura (Option A), or embrace the 'Value' positioning globally and become the undisputed king of the drugstore aisle (Option B). A luxury narrative cannot survive a bargain-bin price tag."

    "why_matters": "When the 'Why' (Empowerment) is stripped away, the product becomes a commodity. The Amazon shopper buys a tool; the Site shopper buys a philosophy. This inconsistency prevents loyalists from forming on the marketplace.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are treating your Amazon presence like a vending machine while trying to build a cathedral on your website. It is time to choose: either infuse the Amazon content with the 'Self-Worth' mission to build true loyalty (Option A), or strip the lofty rhetoric from the website and admit you are in the business of biological repair (Option B). A mission that disappears at the cash register is just marketing fluff."

    "evidence": "Value Perception: WWW 'Daily Essential' vs. PDP 'Bulk Utility'",
    "why_matters": "This is the 'Uncanny Valley' of branding. You are drifting from being a 'Brand' to being a 'Generic' option. If this slide continues, you lose pricing power forever.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are dangerously close to becoming a generic noun rather than a proper noun. The choice is subtle but critical: either elevate the Amazon visual experience to reclaim 'Brand' status (Option A), or lean into the 'Utility' role and win solely on volume efficiency (Option B). You can be a beloved brand or a useful object, but rarely both."

You must decide: either import the raw, messy, viral energy of the Amazon reviews to your homepage (Option A), or continue to rely on sterile 'Consumer Tests' and ignore the army you have already built (Option B). In the digital age, volume is truth."
