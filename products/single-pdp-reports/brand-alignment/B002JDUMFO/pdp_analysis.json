    "description": "L'Oreal Paris commoditizes clinical skincare, transforming 'Collagen' from a luxury treatment into a $10 daily utility. It balances the authority of a dermatological lab with the safety assurances required for mass adoption, positioning itself as the default 'Safe Choice' for anti-aging. The brand functions as a pragmatic engine of restoration, proving that validated science doesn't have to be exclusive."

The USP strategy is The Value Hacker—democratizing a hero ingredient at a price point ($9.99) that undercuts luxury competitors. It focuses on Science Education, using charts and routine guides to teach rather than just inspire."
