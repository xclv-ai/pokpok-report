    "description": "L'Oreal Paris executes a strategy of 'Mass Authority,' effectively bringing clinical credibility to the supermarket aisle. By anchoring on a single hero ingredient ('Collagen') and reinforcing it with overwhelming social proof ('America's #1'), the brand positions itself as the default, safe choice for anti-aging. It removes the risk from skincare shopping by combining the aesthetics of a laboratory with the accessibility of a commodity."
