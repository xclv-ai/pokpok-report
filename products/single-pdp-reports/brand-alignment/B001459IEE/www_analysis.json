    "description": "Aveeno feels like the gold standard for safe, effective, and accessible skincare. It has successfully positioned itself as the trustworthy guardian of sensitive skin, blending the gentle power of nature (oat) with the reassuring authority of clinical science. It doesn't chase trends or luxury; it plays the role of the reliable, family-friendly staple that you can trust to calmly do its job without causing irritation or breaking the bank."

      "title": "The Guardian Democratizer",
      "description": "The brand's purpose is to be a Guardian, using a Hybrid Science approach to protect and maintain skin health. This is balanced by a core value of 'Safety First,' prioritizing gentle, hypoallergenic formulas over aggressive potency. Its positioning is that of a Medical Authority—a sterile, utilitarian staple—but it executes this strategy as a Democratizer, making trusted skin science universally accessible to everyone."

      "title": "The Competent Caregiver",
      "description": "The brand maintains a professional distance, behaving as a Reliable Expert rather than a close friend. This is driven by its dominant Caregiver archetype (70%), which promises protection and safety. The Pharma-Code visuals—clean, controlled, and sterile—reinforce this competence. The Tone of Voice is a Clinical Authority, using a serious, matter-of-fact broadcast frequency to build trust through precision, not personality."

      "description": "The messaging is that of a Problem Solver, leading with the End Benefit of '48-hour moisturization' and using rational persuasion. Its USP is being the Ingredient King of 'Oat,' an unfair advantage it has owned for decades. The origin story is a Lab Breakthrough built on 80 years of research, with Derm-Validation (clinical studies, doctor recommendations) serving as the primary trust anchor. The page focus is squarely on Science Education, teaching the 'how' and 'why' behind the formula."

      "description": "Functionally, the product delivers Restoration, working to fix dryness and replenish the skin's barrier. The core emotional payoff is Relief and Safety—the calming reassurance that your skin is protected and won't react. This reinforces an identity of Self-Expression for The Pragmatist, who buys what works, not what's hyped. Socially, it's The Safe Choice, signaling membership in the majority who value reliable, proven results."
