    "description": "Aveeno feels like the gold standard for safe, effective, and accessible skincare. It masterfully blends gentle, nature-derived science (oat) with overwhelming clinical proof to create a sense of absolute trustworthiness. It doesn't need to shout or seduce with trends; its power lies in its quiet, unwavering competence. Aveeno plays the role of the reliable family doctor you've known for years—calm, reassuring, and always effective."

      "title": "The Scientific Guardian",
      "description": "The brand operates as a Guardian, deriving its authority from a hybrid of nature ('Prebiotic Oat') and overwhelming clinical validation ('Derm-Recommended'). This is balanced by a core value of Safety First, prioritizing tolerance and gentle efficacy over aggressive potency. This strategy solidifies its position as a Medical Authority, delivering a high degree of trust and reliability at a democratic, Utilitarian price point, making it the default family staple."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Competent Caregiver",
      "description": "Aveeno maintains a professional distance, communicating with the calm, cool authority of a Reliable Expert. This is driven by its primary Sage archetype (70%), which prioritizes wisdom and data over emotion. The visual identity is Earthy Organic, using a muted, plant-based aesthetic to signal gentleness and safety. The Tone of Voice is a Clinical Authority—serious, formal, and matter-of-fact—reinforcing its role as a trusted source of truth, not a playful friend."

      "title": "Evidence-Based Persuasion",
      "description": "The messaging strategy is that of a Problem Solver, leading with the End Benefit ('Intensely nourish dry skin') and backing it up with rational proof. The brand's unfair advantage is as an Ingredient King, owning the mental link to 'Oat' for sensitive skin. This is anchored in a Lab Breakthrough narrative built on 80 years of research. The page Focus is on Science Education, using its pixel real estate to prove claims rather than inspire desire."

      "description": "The functional promise is Restoration, focused on healing and repairing dry, compromised skin. This delivers a powerful emotional benefit of Relief and Safety, calming the user's anxiety about irritation and discomfort. For the consumer, this translates into a self-expression signal of being a Pragmatist—a rational person who buys what works. Socially, it is the ultimate Safe Choice, connecting the user to a massive tribe that values proven, reliable results."
