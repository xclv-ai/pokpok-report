    "gap_description": "The WWW site signals the customer is a 'Pragmatist,' a smart, rational buyer making a logical choice. The PDP, leveraging its bestseller status, signals the customer is a 'Trend-Setter' making a culturally validated statement. You are selling utility on one channel and status on the other.",
    "evidence": "[Self-Expression] WWW: 'The Pragmatist' (Smart Choice 2/5) vs. PDP: 'The Trend-Setter' (Statement 4/5)",
    "why_matters": "This conflict confuses the core purchase motivation. Is this a smart, boring necessity or a cool, validated choice? This schizophrenia weakens the brand's identity and makes it impossible to target a single consumer mindset with precision.",
    "the_hard_choice": "The market has decided your product is a cultural staple—a trend of reliability. You must choose: rewrite the PDP to downplay its bestseller status and reinforce the 'Smart Choice' angle (Option A), or embrace your market-proven role as the standard-bearer and update the website to reflect this identity (Option B). You cannot be both the quiet librarian and the prom queen."

    "gap_description": "The WWW site uses a warm, 'Earthy Organic' visual language with beiges and creams, suggesting natural wellness. The PDP uses a cool, 'Pharma-Code' aesthetic with sterile whites and greens, signaling clinical efficacy. One feels like a spa, the other a clinic.",
    "evidence": "[Visual Identity] WWW: 'Earthy Organic' (Warm 4/5) vs. PDP: 'Pharma-Code' (Cool 2/5)",
    "why_matters": "Visuals create an instant emotional connection. A consumer doesn't know if they are buying a gentle, natural remedy or a sterile, scientific solution. This visual schizophrenia makes the customer subconsciously doubt the true nature of the product.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand is visually bilingual, and it's making you sound incoherent. You must pick a lane: either warm up the Amazon visuals with the earthy tones from your website to create a consistent wellness vibe (Option A), or adopt the high-converting clinical 'Pharma-Code' look across all channels to own the authority space (Option B). A brand cannot be both a field and a laboratory."

    "evidence": "[Narrative] WWW Setting: 'Sterile' (1/5) vs. PDP Setting: 'Harvest' (4/5)",
    "why_matters": "The origin story is the soul of the brand. Is your authority rooted in a test tube or an oat field? This conflict dilutes the power of your core ingredient story and confuses the true source of your credibility.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your origin story has a split timeline, creating two different brands. The data demands you choose: discipline the Amazon narrative to focus purely on 70 years of clinical research (Option A), or update the website's story to embrace the powerful 'nature plus science' narrative that is already winning on the marketplace (Option B). Every hero needs one clear origin; yours currently has two."

    "evidence": "[Tone of Voice] Formality Slider: WWW 3/5 (Professional) vs. PDP 2/5 (Traditional)",
    "why_matters": "This minor inconsistency suggests that channel-specific teams are improvising without a central playbook. Over time, this small drift can widen into a significant gap, diluting the brand's authority and creating a disjointed customer experience.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand speaks the same language on both channels, but with a slightly different accent. The WWW site is a professional consultant, while the PDP is a corporate memo. You must decide: codify the more formal 'Professional' voice across all channels to maintain a single standard (Option A), or adopt the slightly more direct PDP voice globally, acknowledging it may be better for a mass-market environment (Option B). Precision in tone is what separates a trusted brand from just another product."

    "evidence": "[Archetypes Mix] Tertiary Archetype: PDP 'The Innocent' (10%) > WWW 'The Innocent' (5%)",
    "why_matters": "Your own website is the conservative bottleneck. The PDP data proves the audience responds to a slightly simpler, more wholesome appeal, yet your brand home underutilizes this emotional lever, clinging to a more sterile, scientific presentation.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon presence has a warmer, more innocent soul, and the market is rewarding it. You face a choice: pull back the 'Innocent' archetype on the PDP to match the more serious corporate stance of the website (Option A), or amplify the 'Innocent' archetype globally because the market craves simple, pure solutions more than complex scientific ones (Option B). Authority is built on wisdom, but loyalty is built on trust."
