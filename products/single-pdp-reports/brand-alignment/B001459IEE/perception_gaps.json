The data demands a choice: either re-architect the PDP to lead with the powerful '72-hour moisture' result (Option A), or demote the outcome-based claims on the WWW to hero the 'Prebiotic Oat' ingredient (Option B).

      "why_matters": "Visuals are physics. The warm, earthy tones of the website promise gentle, natural care, while the cold, sterile visuals on Amazon signal clinical efficiency. This sensory contradiction makes the customer doubt if the product is a soothing balm or a harsh chemical.",

You must decide on the primary signal: either infuse the Amazon A+ content with the warm, beige palette of your website to create a consistent, natural feel (Option A), or strip the earthy aesthetic from your website and embrace a clinical white look to match the high-trust 'Pharma-Code' of the PDP (Option B).

      "evidence": "[PERSONALITY] Emotional Heat Slider: WWW 2/5 (Distant) vs. PDP 3/5 (Pleasant)",
      "why_matters": "This minor drift suggests the PDP team is improvising to improve conversion, slowly creating a new, friendlier personality for the brand. Over time, this erodes the core 'distant expert' positioning, risking the brand's authoritative aura for short-term sales.",
      "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon presence is getting friendlier, writing emotional checks your core brand strategy can't cash. You must make a call: either enforce the 'Distant' warmth standard on the PDP to preserve your authoritative, expert persona (Option A), or officially update the global brand personality to 'Pleasant' because the market data proves a friendlier tone converts better (Option B).

You are at a crossroads: either downgrade the Amazon claim to a weaker 48 hours for the sake of conservative consistency (Option A), or upgrade the website and all global marketing to the superior 72-hour claim because the marketplace has proven it is the winning message (Option B).
