    "description": "d'Alba masterfully bridges the gap between 'Old World Luxury' (Italian Truffles, Gold, Heritage) and 'New World Viral' (K-Beauty, Glass Skin, 50 Million Sold). It feels like an accessible status symbol—a 'spray-on' touch of elegance that democratizes the aesthetic of wealth for the mass market.
