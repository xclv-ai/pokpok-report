    "description": "d'Alba masters the art of 'Functional Luxury' by combining the prestige of White Truffle with the pragmatic speed of a spray format. It positions itself as a makeup-enhancing tool rather than just skincare, solving the specific pain point of 'cakey makeup' with clinical precision. This is High-Performance Masstige: gold-standard ingredients delivered at a viral, global scale (50M units)."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "Bio-Active Empowerment",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the 'White Truffle' (Bio-Active) but directs that power toward aesthetic Enhancement ('Radiant Glow') rather than medical repair. It supports this with a Radical Transparency value system, using specific clinical percentages (+46% oil reduction) to prove that its luxury ingredients actually work. It occupies The Clean Essentialist slot—visually polished enough for Instagram, but functionally positioned as a daily necessity."

    "identity": {
      "title": "Sophisticated Magician",
      "description": "The brand acts as The Luxury Icon, projecting high competence with a polished, professional warmth. The archetype mix is led by The Magician (40%), framing the product as an instant transformation tool ('In a Spritz'), supported by Ruler authority (50M units sold). Visually, it executes an Earthy Organic strategy disguised in gold—using warm tones to signal the botanical origin of its hero ingredient."

      "title": "The Problem Solver",
      "description": "Messaging hooks the user with the 'White Truffle' ingredient but closes the deal with Functional problem-solving ('Cakey Makeup Fix'). The narrative is a Green Lab story: taking a wild harvest (Truffles) and optimizing it in the lab for results. Proof relies on Derm-Validation, leveraging professional makeup artist endorsements to bridge the gap between skincare and cosmetics."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Corrective Radiance",
      "description": "Functionally, it offers Correction, targeting visual perfection ('Patchy to Perfect') rather than invisible health. The emotional payoff is Intelligence—the feeling of having a 'hack' for perfect makeup. Socially, it is The Safe Choice, leveraging massive social proof (50M units) to signal that this is the global standard for glow."
