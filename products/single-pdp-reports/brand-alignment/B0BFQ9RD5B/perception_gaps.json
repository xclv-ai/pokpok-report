    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon strategy is writing checks your website isn't cashing, promising a level of 'Prestige' that the accessible website doesn't fully support. You face a trade-off: either elevate the website's visual codes to true 'Luxury' to match the Amazon hype (Option A), or relax the Amazon claims to 'Daily Essential' and own the volume market honestly (Option B).
