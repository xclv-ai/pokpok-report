    "evidence": "Values: WWW 'Safety First' (2/5 Performance) vs. PDP 'Clinical Efficacy' (4/5 Performance)",
    "why_matters": "A customer seeking 'Clinical Potency' on Amazon will feel misled if they land on a website that only talks about 'Gentle Vegan' formulas. Conversely, sensitive skin shoppers from the site may fear the Amazon claims.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are currently straddling the fence between a 'Clean Beauty' brand (Safe) and a 'Derma-Cosmetic' brand (Effective). The data demands a choice: either purge the aggressive clinical claims from Amazon to protect the gentle luxury aura (Option A), or upgrade the website to 'High-Performance' and accept that 'Gentle' is no longer your primary differentiator (Option B).

    "the_hard_choice": "You are selling 'Insider Status' on your site, but your sales volume proves you are a 'Mass Commodity.' You must decide: either hide the '50 Million' figure to preserve the illusion of the 'Pro's Secret' (Option A), or lean fully into 'The People's Champion' on the website and drop the pretension of exclusivity (Option B).

    "why_matters": "A brand built on 'Everyone is buying it' has no defense when sales slow down. The current strategy is renting authority from the crowd rather than owning it through unique technology or philosophy.",

You face a strategic pivot: either continue riding the 'Viral' high until it fades (Option A), or begin shifting the core validator from 'The Crowd' to 'The Craft' (Proprietary Science/Heritage) now, while you still have the attention (Option B). Popularity is a momentary asset; Authority is a permanent one."

You should decide: either keep the website functional to minimize distraction (Option A), or elevate the 'Sensory Ritual' of the misting action to the center of the global brand story (Option B). Pleasure is often a stronger driver than perfection."
