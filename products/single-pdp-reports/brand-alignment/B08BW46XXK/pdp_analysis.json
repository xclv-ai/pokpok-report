    "description": "Vanicream functions as a sterile safe harbor for skin in crisis. It explicitly rejects the language of 'beauty' and 'luxury' to act as a medical-grade tool for survival, anchoring its value entirely in what it removes (irritants) rather than what it adds. It is the pragmatic choice for the user who fears a reaction more than they desire a glow."

      "title": "The Guardian of Sensitivity",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the clinic (Derm-Validated) with a mission to Protect sensitive skin from environmental and chemical threats. Its value system is ruthlessly 'Safety First,' sacrificing all sensory pleasure (fragrance, texture hype) to guarantee zero irritation. It positions itself as The Medical Authority—a utility product that belongs in a medicine cabinet, not a vanity shelf."

      "title": "The Stoic Caregiver",
      "description": "The personality is a Reliable Expert—distant, professional, and entirely focused on competence. This is driven by The Caregiver archetype (70%), which creates a massive sense of reassurance through badges like 'National Eczema Association.' Visually, it uses Pharma-Code aesthetics (medical blue and white) to signal that this is a health product, not a cosmetic one."

      "title": "The Negative Space",
      "description": "Messaging is defined by The Chemist territory, focusing on the absence of negatives ('Free-From') rather than the presence of magic. The USP is The Specialist, targeting the specific niche of 'Sensitive Skin' with laser focus. Proof comes from 'The List' (grids of what isn't inside) and Science Education content that prioritizes clarity over inspiration."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Biological Sanctuary",
      "description": "Functionally, it offers Protection and Restoration for the skin barrier, ignoring aesthetic correction. The emotional payoff is Relief/Safety—the absence of anxiety about a flare-up. Socially, it is The Safe Choice, a Pragmatist's badge that signals a rejection of marketing fluff in favor of what medically works."
