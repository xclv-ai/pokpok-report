The data demands a choice: either revert the Amazon listing to focus on 'Sensitive Skin' to own the diagnosis (Option A), or update the website to highlight 'Ceramides' and compete as a commodity ingredient brand (Option B).

You must align the emotional frequency: either inject the 'Reassurance' warmth into Amazon to calm the shopper (Option A), or pivot the website to address the 'Panic' directly to convert the high-pain user (Option B).
