    "gap_description": "The WWW positions the brand's 'Free-From' status as a Proprietary System (5/5)—an intellectual asset of exclusion. The PDP pivots to selling commodities like 'Ceramides' (1/5) to capture search traffic. You are diluting your unique 'Absence' strategy to compete in the 'Presence' game.",
    "evidence": "WWW: 'We specialize in Sensitive Skin Care' (System) vs. PDP: 'With Ceramides and Hyaluronic Acid' (Commodity)",
    "why_matters": "CeraVe owns the 'Ceramide' mental slot. Vanicream owns the 'Free-From' slot. By pushing ingredients on Amazon, you enter a battle you cannot win, while neglecting the 'Purity' moat that makes you unique.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You face a strategic fork in the road regarding your moat. Option A: Double down on the 'Free-From' System on Amazon, stripping the commodity ingredient claims to differentiate sharply from CeraVe.

    "gap_description": "The WWW relies on the 'Pharmacist Origin' (1/5)—a human story of two founders in a hospital. The PDP relies on 'Derm-Validated' authority (2/5)—a faceless consensus of doctors. One is a story; the other is a statistic.",
    "evidence": "WWW: 'In 1974 we were both pharmacists' vs. PDP: '#1 Dermatologist Recommended'",
    "why_matters": "Institutional trust is eroding; human trust is rising. Relying solely on 'The Board' (Dermatologists) makes the brand feel corporate and cold, whereas the Founder story provides a heartbeat to the science.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are currently splitting your authority source. You must decide: either humanize the Amazon presence by reintroducing the Pharmacist founders to build emotional trust (Option A), or erase the founders from the website to become the ultimate faceless Institutional Authority (Option B).

    "evidence": "WWW: 'Ingredients that are essential components' (Logic) vs. PDP: 'Free of dyes, fragrance, lanolin' (Data List)",
    "why_matters": "Data without context is just noise. The Amazon user is looking for reassurance, not just a checklist. The lack of 'Rational' bridging copy makes the product feel more like a chemical supply than a skincare solution.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your messaging varies between teaching and listing. The choice is clear: either upgrade the Amazon content to explain *why* the exclusion matters (Option A), or strip the website down to raw data tables to match the 'Spec Sheet' efficiency of the marketplace (Option B). You can be a Teacher or a Datasheet, but not both."

    "evidence": "Visual Identity: 90% Alignment on 'Pharma-Code' (Sterile Blue/White)",

    "the_hard_choice": "You have successfully branded yourself as a hospital supply product. The risk is that you stay there. You must choose: either inject a degree of 'Lifestyle' visual warmth to compete with modern derm-brands (Option A), or commit fully to the 'Generic Drug' aesthetic to own the price/value perception (Option B). There is no middle ground for 'almost sterile.'"

    "why_matters": "The Amazon performance suggests that users are coming to Vanicream out of fear (needing safety), not logic. The website is under-leveraging this emotional need for a 'Safe Harbor.'",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon listing is screaming 'SAFE' while your website is politely saying 'effective.' The data suggests fear converts. You should either rewrite the global brand to be the 'Paranoid Protector' (Option A), or dial back the fear-mongering on Amazon to maintain a more 'Scientific' posture (Option B). Safety is a powerful drug; don't dilute the dose."
