You are trying to be a soulful heritage brand at home and a sterile clinical brand in the market.",
    "evidence": "[NARRATIVE] WWW: 'The Ritual' (Founder/1882) vs. PDP: 'The Lab Breakthrough' (Antioxidants/Experts)",
    "why_matters": "A heritage story provides soul, while a lab story provides function. By splitting them, you strip the Amazon listing of its emotional weight and the Website of its modern efficacy. The consumer doesn't know if they are buying a legend or a chemical.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are currently straddling the past and the present, failing to own either. The data demands a decision: either modernize the global narrative to 'Lab Breakthrough' and kill the Andrew Jergens story (Option A), or inject the 'Ritual' heritage into Amazon to differentiate from soulless generics (Option B).

You must choose: either strip the 'Fun' from Amazon to maintain the clinical authority of the #1 Derm brand (Option A), or update the website to match the 'Lifestyle' energy and admit you are now a beauty brand, not just a moisturizer (Option B).

You must decide: either restrain the Amazon creative to the 'Earthy Organic' palette to reclaim premium control (Option A), or rebrand the website to 'Gen-Z Pop' and chase the younger demographic fully (Option B).

    "why_matters": "Being the 'Safe Choice' is a comfortable trap. It prevents you from losing customers, but it rarely inspires new ones to switch from sexier competitors. You are competing on 'Not screwing up' rather than 'Being amazing.'",
    "the_hard_choice": "You have successfully built a moat of safety around your brand, but moats don't capture new territory. You face a strategic choice: either remain the 'Safe Utility' and accept slow, defensive growth (Option A), or pivot one channel to 'Performance' to attack the vanity market (Option B). Safety prevents returns, but it rarely creates fans."

You have an opportunity: either keep the 'Soul' messaging contained to the site to avoid confusing the mass market (Option A), or unleash the 'Guru' persona on Amazon to elevate the commodity lotion into a wellness ritual (Option B).
