    "gap_description": "The WWW signals 'The Green Lab' (Nature Optimized), focusing on ingredients like Coconut Oil and Vitamin E. The PDP signals 'The Lab Breakthrough' (Pure Science), focusing on Odor-Ban technology and Dermatologist ratings. One is a harvest story; the other is a clinic story.",
    "evidence": "WWW: 'Revitalizing formula with Vitamin E' (Nature) vs. PDP: 'Odor-Ban Technology' (Tech)",
    "why_matters": "The consumer is confused about the source of efficacy. If the brand is 'Natural', the heavy chemical/tech talk on Amazon erodes trust. If the brand is 'Clinical', the soft nature focus on the site feels weak.",

You must choose the source of your authority: either strip the tech-heavy claims from Amazon to own the 'Gentle Nature' position (Option A), or purge the soft ingredient storytelling from the site to fully own the 'High-Performance Science' territory (Option B). You cannot be a florist and a chemist at the same time."

    "why_matters": "Visual inconsistency destroys brand recall. The Amazon page looks like a completely different, younger brand than the website. This suggests the Amazon team is chasing trends while the Brand team is protecting history.",
    "the_hard_choice": "The Amazon creative suggests the brand is trying to age down, while the website remains conservative. You face a visual ultimatum: either force the Amazon listings into the 'Heritage Beige' constraints to signal premium maturity (Option A), or update the global brand guidelines to 'Electric Pop' and accept that you are now a youth brand (Option B).

    "why_matters": "While the core promises align, the intensity on Amazon is drifting into hyperbole. Over-promising 'Flawless' results on Amazon may lead to higher return rates or disappointment if the product is actually a subtle 'Gradual' tanner as described on the site.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Amazon is writing checks that the product formulation might not cash. You need to calibrate the promise: either restrain the Amazon copy to 'Healthy Glow' to protect long-term integrity (Option A), or upgrade the product claims globally to 'Flawless Perfection' and accept the higher scrutiny that comes with it (Option B). Hype works for the sale, but honesty works for the repurchase."

    "why_matters": "The 'Caregiver' (Safety) archetype is the brand's heritage, but the 'Innocent' (Joy) archetype is the category driver. The Amazon content proves that selling 'Sunshine' is more powerful than selling 'Moisture'.",

The data suggests a pivot: either pull Amazon back to 'Safety First' to minimize risk (Option A), or unleash the 'Innocent' archetype globally to transform the brand from a utility into a mood booster (Option B). Safety sells lotion; Joy sells a lifestyle."
