    "evidence": "[VISUAL IDENTITY] WWW: 'Soft, light peach... Heritage Warm' vs. PDP: 'Pink inflatable pool... Vibrant yellow and magenta'",
    "why_matters": "This visual bipolarity breaks brand recognition. The user landing on the site feels like they've stepped into a time machine to 2005, while the Amazon user is getting a dopamine hit. You cannot own 'Glow' if you look dull on your own homepage.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are currently running two different visual brands under one logo. The data demands a decision: either repaint the global identity to match the high-energy 'Gen-Z Pop' aesthetic that is likely converting on Amazon (Option A), or discipline the Amazon creative to respect the 'Heritage' beige restraint (Option B). You can be classic or you can be current, but you cannot be both at the same time."

    "why_matters": "DTC sites exist to build the dream, yet yours is purely transactional. Amazon exists to transact, yet yours is inspirational. This role reversal suggests the Amazon team understands the emotional hook better than the Brand team.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your own website is failing to deliver the emotional premium of the brand. You face a strategic ultimatum: either upgrade the WWW experience to a 'Lifestyle Destination' that out-vibes Amazon (Option A), or accept that your site is merely a vending machine and strip the 'Storytelling' pretense (Option B).

    "evidence": "[NARRATIVE] WWW: 'Nature optimized... Coconut Oil' vs. PDP: 'Without your derm getting nervous'",
    "why_matters": "Inconsistency in the 'Hero' story confuses the buyer about the mechanism of action. Is it a natural extract or a clinical formulation? Mixing these signals dilutes the authority of both.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are oscillating between a 'Nature' story and a 'Science' story. The market rewards clarity, so you must choose: either commit to the 'Green Lab' narrative and highlight the botanical origins globally (Option A), or pivot to the 'Clinical Safety' narrative and lead with the Dermatologist validation everywhere (Option B). You cannot claim the authority of nature and the safety of the lab with equal weight."

    "evidence": "[PERSONALITY] WWW: 'Love from Cincinnati' vs. PDP: 'Without your derm getting nervous'",
    "why_matters": "The Amazon copy assumes the customer is anxious (about orange skin/derm approval), while the WWW copy assumes the customer is happy. If the customer is actually anxious, the WWW tone reads as naive.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon team is addressing a consumer fear that your Brand team is ignoring. You must decide: either tighten the global voice to 'Protective Authority' to address the anxiety of self-tanning (Option A), or maintain the 'Carefree Friend' persona and risk seeming out of touch with user concerns (Option B). Optimism is great, but reassurance sells."

You have an opportunity to scale a win: either adopt the 'Visual Sunshine' language from Amazon across your global identity (Option A), or restrict the metaphor to text-only and lose the sensory impact (Option B). A metaphor you can see is infinitely stronger than one you can only read."
