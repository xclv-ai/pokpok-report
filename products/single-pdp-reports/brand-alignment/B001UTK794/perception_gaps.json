    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon team is prioritizing approachability over authority. While this builds rapport, it erodes the premium medical equity. You face a choice: either tighten the Amazon voice to reassert your expertise (Option A), or soften the global brand to match the peer-to-peer reality of the category (Option B).

Polite brands rarely make history."
