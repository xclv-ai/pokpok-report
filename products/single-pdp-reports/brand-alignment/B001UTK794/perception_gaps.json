    "evidence": "WWW: 'The confident control... It just feels good to glow' vs. PDP: 'WITHOUT YOUR DERM GETTING NERVOUS... hassle-free'",
    "why_matters": "This split personality creates a value gap. Confidence commands a premium; Safety is a commodity. By leading with 'Don't worry, it won't ruin your skin' on Amazon, you are negotiating against yourself.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are caught between selling the dream of beauty and the mitigation of a nightmare. You must choose: either purge the defensive 'Safety' language from Amazon to maintain the premium 'Confidence' aura (Option A), or accept that this is a functional category and pivot the website to the 'Safe Choice' narrative to drive volume (Option B).

    "why_matters": "Brand homes are supposed to build desire; marketplaces are supposed to harvest it. Jergens has flipped the funnel. The website feels cheap and utilitarian compared to the 'Sun-drenched' dream on Amazon, likely increasing bounce rates on the DTC site.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your own website is undercutting the brand equity built on Amazon. This is a structural failure. You must decide: either elevate the DTC site to match the 'Lifestyle Aesthetic' of the PDP and justify the click (Option A), or strip the Amazon listing down to a 'Hard Sell' to match the website's efficiency and admit you are a commodity (Option B). A flagship cannot be less inspiring than a kiosk."

    "evidence": "WWW: 'Something sunnier about life' (Innocent) vs. PDP: 'Deepen your natural skin tone' (Magician)",
    "why_matters": "Inconsistency in secondary archetypes dilutes the personality. 'Innocent' says 'Be Happy'; 'Magician' says 'Be Changed'. The user senses a subtle shift from 'Wholesome' to 'Alchemic' which can confuse expectations of the result.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are drifting between a story of 'Happy Skin' and 'Magic Tan'. You must lock the secondary archetype: either commit to 'The Innocent' globally to own the emotional high ground (Option A), or switch to 'The Magician' to own the transformative power of the product (Option B). Optimism is nice, but magic sells results."

    "evidence": "Messaging Hook: PDP (5/5 The Dream) > WWW (4/5 The Result)",
    "why_matters": "When the marketplace over-promises compared to the brand home, it creates a 'Hype Gap'. Users buying the 'Flawless' dream on Amazon may feel let down by the 'Daily Moisturizer' reality presented on the site, leading to return risks.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon copywriters are writing checks the Brand Strategy might not want to cash. You face a discipline choice: either rein in the Amazon superlatives to match the grounded reality of the website (Option A), or unleash the website copy to match the 'Dream' level intensity of the PDP (Option B). Consistency in promise prevents disappointment in reality."

    "why_matters": "It is rare to see such perfect alignment on a high-level purpose. This is the brand's sharpest weapon. It is currently treating this as a tagline, but it should be the organizing principle of the entire business.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You have stumbled upon a world-class purpose—'Psychological Sunshine'—but you are treating it like just another header. You have a massive opportunity: either continue using it as nice decoration (Option A), or restructure the entire visual and verbal identity around 'Empowerment' to aggressively separate yourself from the functional 'Self-Tanner' category (Option B). You are selling mood, not melanin."
