However, a radical visual and narrative split exists between the 'Heritage' website and the 'Gen-Z' Amazon listing, suggesting a deliberate but disjointed attempt to age-down the brand on marketplaces."

The data demands a choice: either update the website to match the high-energy 'Gen-Z Pop' aesthetic of the Amazon listing to capture the youth market (Option A), or restrain the Amazon creative to 'Heritage Warm' to preserve the trust of your core legacy audience (Option B). You cannot be both a timeless classic and a trendy viral hit."
