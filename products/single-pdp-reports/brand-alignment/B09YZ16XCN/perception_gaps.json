    "why_matters": "A brand's archetype is its soul. When the soul is split, customers don't know who they are in a relationship with. This confusion erodes trust and makes the brand feel like a functional tool rather than a trusted partner, killing loyalty.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You have two distinct personalities, and one is likely driving more value than the other. You must choose: either commit to the PDP's authoritative 'Sage' persona and update the website to be a hub of clinical education (Option A), or double down on the WWW's protective 'Caregiver' and soften the PDP's hard-edged data with more reassuring language (Option B). You cannot be both the warm hug and the cold, hard fact."

    "the_hard_choice": "The market is telling you two different stories about what matters. You must decide which promise to keep. Option A: Embrace the PDP's 'Safety First' value system, which broadens your audience but may dilute performance claims. Option B: Commit to the WWW's 'Radical Transparency' and own the high-performance space, accepting you may alienate more cautious buyers.

    "gap_description": "While both channels align on 'The Medical Authority,' there's a subtle but important drift. The WWW feels like a 'Clinical Sterile' lab with zero emotion, while the PDP has a slightly warmer, more commercial 'Professional' feel, like a doctor's practice. One is pure science, the other is applied science.",

    "the_hard_choice": "This is not a crisis, but a point of strategic refinement. The brand must decide on its ideal bedside manner. Option A: Embrace the PDP's more polished 'Professional' aesthetic across the board, which may improve accessibility and conversion. Option B: Enforce the WWW's stark 'Clinical Sterile' identity everywhere to maintain an aura of pure, uncompromising science. Even in medicine, the environment shapes the patient's trust."

    "evidence": "[SELF-EXPRESSION] Signal Driver Slider: WWW 'The Tool (1/5)' vs. PDP 'The Smart Choice (2/5)'",

Option A: Accept being 'The Tool' and prepare to compete on price and distribution forever. Option B: Proactively adopt the PDP's 'Smart Choice' narrative globally, building a brand around practical intelligence and earning a sliver of loyalty. A hammer is just a hammer until it becomes the one smart builders choose."
