It has shed any 'old-fashioned' perceptions to become a highly credible, data-driven solution for a specific problem ('crepey skin'). It differentiates by acting not as a cosmetic but as a targeted treatment, validated by both clinical statistics and massive social proof. It plays the role of the reliable, no-nonsense dermatologist in a bottle."
