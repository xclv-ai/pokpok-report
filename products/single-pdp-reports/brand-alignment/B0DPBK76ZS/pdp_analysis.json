    "description": "Hempz positions itself as the accessible bridge between nature and science. It leverages the inherent mystique of 'The Seed' (Hemp) but validates it with clinical precision (Niacinamide, Omega-6), creating a 'Green Lab' authority.

      "title": "Indulgent Formula Purity",
      "description": "Functionally, it offers Hydration and Maintenance. Emotionally, it provides Indulgence—a private sanctuary of 'Vanilla Lux.' However, the primary proof point is Formula Purity—a rigorous checklist of what is *not* in the bottle (THC, Parabens, Gluten) to guarantee safety."
