    "description": "Medicube successfully hybridizes two opposing worlds: the rigour of a clinical lab and the dopamine hit of viral K-Beauty. It feels like a 'serious toy'—a product that offers the safety of dermatological science ('Global Institute') wrapped in the sensory delight of pink jelly. It doesn't just promise hydration; it promises the specific, highly online aesthetic of 'Glass Skin' backed by hard sales data."

The focus is a Hard Product Sell (Marker 13), prioritizing transaction speed and popularity over deep education."

Socially, it acts as The Safe Choice (Marker 17), using its massive 'Best Seller' status to remove the risk of trying something new."
