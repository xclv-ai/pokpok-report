    "headline": "The \"What\" vs. The \"Why\"",
    "gap_description": "The brand's core message is slightly diluted. The WWW focuses on its unique positioning as the go-to solution for specific, compromised skin conditions. The PDP, while similar, broadens the use case and puts more emphasis on the multi-ingredient formula itself.",
    "evidence": "[USP] WWW: Commodity ingredient but hyper-specialist scope (1/5 Ownership, 5/5 Scope) vs. PDP: Signature complex for a broad problem-solver scope (3/5 Ownership, 4/5 Scope).",
    "why_matters": "This minor drift creates an opening for a competitor. By blurring its focus, a more specialized brand could potentially steal the niche for \"cracked heels\" or \"chapped lips\" by being more singularly focused than Aquaphor appears on Amazon.",
    "the_hard_choice": "The brand's USP is its point of highest friction. The data requires a choice: either sharpen the Amazon copy to match the website's laser-focus on severe skin conditions (Option A), or evolve the website's story to embrace the 'Signature Complex' formula, shifting focus from *what it solves* to *how it's made* (Option B). You can own a diagnosis or you can own a formula, but trying to own both creates exploitable noise."

  "truth_2": {
    "truth_type": "gap",
    "headline": "The Professor vs. The President",
    "gap_description": "There is a subtle but important shift in the brand's source of authority between channels. The WWW uses 'The Ruler' as its secondary archetype, signaling trust through market dominance and control. The PDP swaps this for 'The Sage,' signaling trust through data and wisdom.",
    "evidence": "[Archetypes Mix] WWW Secondary Archetype: 'The Ruler' (Control) vs. PDP Secondary Archetype: 'The Sage' (Wisdom).",
    "why_matters": "This changes why a customer trusts the brand. Do they trust it because it's the #1 market leader that imposes order on their skin (Ruler)? Or do they trust it because it's the most proven, data-backed choice (Sage)? This nuance dictates whether the customer feels commanded or convinced.",
    "the_hard_choice": "The brand's persona is splitting hairs between two authority figures. The data demands a decision: either lean into The Sage on the website by replacing authoritative language with more charts and clinical explanations to match the PDP (Option A), or force the PDP to adopt The Ruler's voice, emphasizing #1 status over clinical details (Option B). Authority can come from the throne or the library, but not both at once."

  "truth_3": {
    "truth_type": "gap",
    "headline": "Logical vs. Factual Persuasion",
    "gap_description": "Both channels use rational arguments, but the persuasion method differs. The WWW uses a softer, logical approach (cause and effect), while the PDP is more direct and clinical, relying on raw data and proof points.",
    "evidence": "[Messaging] WWW Persuasion Logic: 'Rational' (2/5) vs. PDP Persuasion Logic: 'Raw Data' (1/5).",
    "why_matters": "The PDP is more aggressive and efficient, likely adapted for the high-speed comparison mindset of an Amazon shopper. The WWW takes more time to build its case, which might be less effective for a customer who is actively seeking a quick, proven solution.",
    "the_hard_choice": "The brand is speaking two dialects of the same language. The Amazon PDP uses direct, hard-hitting data, while the website builds a softer, logical case. You must decide: either sharpen the website copy to be as direct and clinical as the PDP (Option A), or soften the PDP to tell more of a story, risking a conversion dip for the sake of narrative consistency (Option B). In a competitive marketplace, speed often wins, suggesting the website is the one that needs to evolve."

    "headline": "The Grid vs. The Structure",
    "gap_description": "The brand's visual identity is highly consistent, but a tiny crack is showing. The WWW adheres to a rigid, controlled 'Swiss Grid' layout, while the PDP has adapted to a slightly more flexible 'Structured' layout, likely to accommodate Amazon's A+ Content format.",
    "evidence": "[Visual Identity] WWW Entropy Scale: 'Swiss Grid' (1/5) vs. PDP Entropy Scale: 'Structured' (2/5).",
    "why_matters": "This is not a problem today, but it's a hidden risk. The PDP's adaptation is a pragmatic choice, but if platform-specific adaptations continue without being harmonized back into the global brand guide, the visual identity could slowly fragment over time.",
    "the_hard_choice": "The brand's visual discipline is world-class, but a subtle variance has emerged. You face a choice: either invest in custom graphics to force the PDP back into the rigid grid of the website, prioritizing absolute consistency above all else (Option A), or update the global brand guide to reflect the more pragmatic, structured reality of the marketplace (Option B). A brand guide that doesn't reflect reality is not a guide; it's a history book."

  "truth_5": {
    "truth_type": "potential_strength",
    "headline": "The Mission Is Clearer Than The Purpose",
    "gap_description": "While both channels perfectly align on 'The Healer' purpose, the direct, problem-focused environment of the PDP makes this purpose even more potent. The website has to build context for a visitor; Amazon presents the solution to a shopper who is already in pain.",
    "evidence": "[Purpose] 100% Alignment on 'The Healer' (Clinical Correction).",
    "why_matters": "This isn't a flaw; it's a strategic insight. The brand's core purpose thrives in a commercial environment where the customer is actively seeking a fix. This suggests that marketing efforts should focus on intercepting customers at their point of pain, not just on broad brand-building.",
    "the_hard_choice": "The brand's purpose is consistent, but its context is not. The Amazon PDP is a surgical tool, applying the 'Healer' purpose to a customer in need; the website is a library, explaining that purpose to a visitor. The hard choice is: do you continue to invest in the library, hoping to attract researchers (Option A), or reallocate those resources to create more surgical tools for different marketplaces, meeting the patient in the operating room (Option B)? A brand's purpose is only as strong as its ability to be present at the moment of need."
