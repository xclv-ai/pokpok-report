      "title": "The Clinical Healer",
      "description": "The brand's purpose is unmistakably that of The Healer, deriving its authority from the clinical lab to fix pathological skin issues like 'cracked' and 'irritated' skin. This is reinforced by a Safety First value system that prioritizes gentle, 'preservative and fragrance free' formulations over aggressive potency.

Its USP is as The Specialist, the go-to for compromised skin, validated by its #1 dermatologist recommended' KSP. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, built on 100 years of clinical history, and the content focus is on Science Education, proving its efficacy through data and authority claims."

For the user, it signals a Pragmatist identity—a rational person who buys what works. This makes it The Safe Choice socially, a purchase validated by the consensus of medical professionals and the mainstream."
