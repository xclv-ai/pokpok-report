    "description": "Aquaphor feels like a prescription you can buy at the supermarket. It has successfully positioned itself as the default, no-nonsense solution for damaged skin, completely stripping away aesthetic desire in favor of pure, functional healing. It plays the role of the trusted family doctor in a tube—reliable, authoritative, and there to fix a problem, not to pamper."
