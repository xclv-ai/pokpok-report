    "description": "Dr.Althea successfully merges the rigor of the clinic with the aesthetics of the vanity. By decoding its formula into a numerical system ('345'), it projects a 'Transparency as Luxury' strategy, validating natural ingredients through a pharmaceutical lens. It is a 'Masstige' specialist that offers the safety of a doctor's visit with the visual pleasure of a lifestyle brand."

      "title": "The Clinical Guardian",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in a hybrid of 'Meticulous Clinical Research' and natural wisdom (Althea goddess). It adopts a 'Safety First' value system, prioritizing the 'Relief' of sensitive skin above all else. Strategically, it occupies the 'Clean Essentialist' slot—selling the clinical aesthetic ('Pharma-Code') at a democratic price point."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Polished Healer",
      "description": "The personality is a 'Reliable Expert'—authoritative yet aesthetically conscious ('Pinterest-worthy packaging').

    "communication": {
      "title": "The Decoded Specialist",
      "description": "Messaging is intellectual, using the '345' code to hook the 'Chemist' part of the brain that craves rational explanation. The USP is the 'Signature Complex'—a proprietary ratio of ingredients that validates the product as a 'Specialist' solution for post-acne recovery. It relies on 'Formula Purity' as its primary proof."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Sanctuary",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a 'Restoration' engine, designed to repair a compromised barrier rather than just hydrate. This delivers an emotional payoff of 'Relief/Safety'—the removal of skin anxiety. Socially, it acts as a badge for 'The Knowledge Club,' signaling membership in the educated K-Beauty tribe."
