The Tone of Voice is Clinical Authority: grave, data-driven, and focused on verifying truth."

      "title": "The Problem Solver",
      "description": "Messaging hooks the user with 'Relief' and 'Recovery,' acting as The Problem Solver for specific conditions. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough story, citing 'Clinical Trials' and 'Institutes' as the protagonist. It uses Derm-Validation as its primary proof, educating the user through 'The Textbook' focus on ingredient percentages and diagrams."
