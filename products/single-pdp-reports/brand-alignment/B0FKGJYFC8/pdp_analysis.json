    "description": "Dr. Althea acts as a precise, medical-grade intervention for compromised skin, merging the rigors of Korean dermatology with a minimalist 'Clean Beauty' philosophy. It does not sell generic moisture; it sells specific 'Relief' for post-acne trauma using a proprietary 3-4-5 nutrient complex. The brand feels like a trusted dermatologist who also practices mindfulness—delivering raw clinical data (+177% hydration) wrapped in a serene, 'Soul Liberation' aesthetic."

      "title": "The Clinical Healer",
      "description": "The brand positions itself as The Healer, deriving authority from 'Derma Inspired' science and the 'Korea Institute of Dermatological Sciences.' Its mission is pure Restoration—fixing specific pathologies like 'post-acne marks' and 'blemishes' rather than generic enhancement. It operates on a Safety First value system, prioritizing 'Clean Formula' and 'Hypoallergenic' tolerance over aggressive actives."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Reliable Philosopher",
      "description": "The personality is The Reliable Expert—distant, authoritative, and precise—using a 'Dr.' moniker and clinical black-and-white codes. The archetype mix is dominated by The Sage (60%), seeking truth through data and transparency, supported by The Caregiver's desire to soothe. Visually, it executes a Pharma-Code identity: sterile white tubes, serif fonts, and data tables that signal the pharmacy, not the playground."

    "communication": {
      "title": "The Data-Driven Problem Solver",
      "description": "Messaging acts as The Problem Solver, hooking the user with the result ('Relief') and persuading them with Raw Data ('+177.34% Hydration'). The USP is The Specialist, owning the niche of 'Post-Acne Relief' via its proprietary '3-4-5' Signature Complex. The focus is strictly Science Education, using the PDP as a textbook to explain ingredients and clinical results."

      "title": "Restorative Safety",

Emotionally, it provides Relief / Safety, selling the absence of irritation ('Calming') rather than the presence of joy. Socially, it appeals to The Knowledge Club—connoisseurs who recognize the 'Dr. Althea' name and its specific K-Beauty clinical pedigree."
