    "headline": "The Clinical Relief Architect",
    "description": "Dr. Althea bypasses the beauty counter to set up shop directly in the laboratory. By coding its identity through the '345' numerical system and stark pharmaceutical aesthetics, it positions itself not as a cosmetic option but as a medical necessity for compromised skin. It offers the relief of a prescription with the accessibility of a daily moisturizer."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Safe Healer",
      "description": "The brand grounds its authority in a Clinical Origin, using the 'Dr.' moniker and institutional seals to promise Restoration for damaged skin. It adheres to a Safety First value system, sacrificing aggressive potency for guaranteed tolerance on sensitive faces. The positioning is The Medical Authority—a utility-focused product that feels like it belongs in a first-aid kit rather than a vanity case."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Stoic Pharmacist",
      "description": "The relationship is defined by The Reliable Expert—distant, competent, and focused entirely on the problem. Driven by the Caregiver archetype (60%), it uses a Pharma-Code visual identity of stark whites and data grids to signal safety. The Tone of Voice is Clinical Authority—dry, precise, and devoid of humor."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Data-Driven Recovery",
      "description": "The messaging is The Problem Solver, hooking the user with the promise of 'Relief' and proving it with Rational data ('177% boost'). The USP is The Specialist, targeting the specific niche of post-acne recovery with its '345' complex. The focus is Science Education, using the PDP to teach the user about barrier repair mechanisms."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Barrier Restoration",
      "description": "Functionally, the product is a Restorer, designed to fix broken barriers and soothe irritation. The Emotional Benefit is Relief/Safety—the absence of pain and anxiety about breakouts. Socially, it is The Pragmatist's choice—a logical tool for those who prioritize results over trends."
