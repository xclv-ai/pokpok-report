    "description": "Dr. Althea positions itself as a precise, medical-grade intervention for compromised skin. It rejects emotional marketing in favor of 'Pharma-Code' aesthetics and 'Spec Sheet' transparency, leveraging the authority of the '345' formula structure to signal engineered relief. It plays the role of the stoic dermatologist who fixes the problem without trying to be your friend."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Safety Engineer",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the Lab (Clinical Origin) with a singular mission of Repair (Restoration). It prioritizes Safety First above all else, sacrificing mystery for 'Spec Sheet' transparency where every ingredient is listed on the front of the tube. It occupies the Medical Authority slot, framing the product as a necessary utility for pathology rather than a luxury."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Sterile Expert",
      "description": "The relationship is defined by high Competence and low Warmth, creating The Reliable Expert persona. Dominated by The Caregiver (60%) and Sage (30%) archetypes, it protects through knowledge. The visual identity is pure Pharma-Code—stark white, black text, and grid layouts—delivered with a Clinical Authority voice that speaks in data ('177% boost') rather than sentences."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "The Transparent Chemist",
      "description": "Messaging hooks the user with The Component (ingredients) and persuades with Raw Data (clinical trials). The USP is The Specialist, claiming ownership of the 'Post-Acne' niche via its proprietary '345' formula structure. The focus is entirely on Science Education, using the PDP as a textbook to prove mechanism rather than inspire desire."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Peace",
      "description": "Functionally, it delivers Restoration, acting as a 'Fixer' for damaged barriers. The payoff is Emotional Relief—the removal of anxiety regarding skin reactions. Socially, it functions as The Safe Choice, a pragmatic tool for those who want to normalize their skin condition rather than signal status."
