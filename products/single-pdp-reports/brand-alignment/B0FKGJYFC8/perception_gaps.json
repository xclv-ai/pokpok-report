    "gap_description": "WWW signals 'The Clean Essentialist' (Aesthetics 4/5), focusing on 'Pinterest-worthy packaging' and shelf appeal. PDP signals 'The Medical Authority' (Aesthetics 2/5), focusing on 'Clinical trials' and 'Scientific glass apparatus.' You are selling a decoration on your site and a medical device on Amazon.",
    "evidence": "WWW: 'Pinterest-worthy packaging' vs. PDP: 'Scientific glass apparatus image'",
    "why_matters": "Consumers buying a 'Dr.' brand want efficacy, not just a pretty tube. By prioritizing aesthetics on the WWW, you undermine the 'Medical Authority' established on the PDP, making the product look like 'Masstige' fluff rather than a serious dermatological intervention.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are caught between being an influencer brand and a dermatology brand. The data shows the PDP is converting on 'Science' while the WWW is posing on 'Style.' You must choose: either lean into the 'Pinterest' angle and soften the clinical claims to become a lifestyle brand (Option A), or purge the vanity metrics from the website and commit to the 'Sterile Lab' aesthetic to own the high-performance medical niche (Option B). You cannot be both a prop and a prescription."

    "evidence": "WWW: 'Inspired by founder Evelyn Lee' vs. PDP: 'Clinical trial conducted by Korea Institute'",
    "why_matters": "This disconnect breaks the trust chain. A customer convinced by the 'Founder's Story' on social media lands on Amazon and sees a faceless clinical brand. A customer convinced by the 'Lab Data' on Amazon lands on the site and sees a personal blog. The emotional hook is incompatible with the intellectual hook.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are telling two different origin stories. One is emotional (Founder), the other is institutional (Institute). You must align the myth: either erase the Institute to make the brand intimate and human (Option A), or retire the Founder narrative to make the brand an absolute institutional authority (Option B). A doctor needs a degree, not a backstory."

    "evidence": "WWW: 'Viral reputation' vs. PDP: '+177.34% Hydration / 3-4-5 Formula'",
    "why_matters": "Your website treats the customer like a fan; your PDP treats them like a student. The PDP approach builds long-term loyalty through education, while the WWW approach relies on fleeting trends. When the trend dies, the WWW dies, but the PDP's 'Knowledge Club' remains.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are currently treating your product as a 'Viral Hit' on your site and a 'Clinical Tool' on the marketplace. This fractures your audience into 'Trend Chasers' and 'Skin Intellectuals.' You must decide: either dumb down the Amazon listing to maximize mass-market 'Trend' appeal (Option A), or elevate the website content to 'The Knowledge Club' standard and stop relying on 'Viral' vanity (Option B). Trends fade; efficacy is forever."

    "evidence": "WWW: 'Healing spirit of Althea' vs. PDP: 'Derma Inspired / Korea Institute'",
    "why_matters": "The 'Dr.' in your name is your biggest asset. Diluting it with too much 'Botanical Spirit' (WWW) weakens the price power of the clinical results. You risk looking like 'pseudo-science' rather than 'hard science.'",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are flirting with nature imagery on your site while selling hard chemistry on Amazon. This creates a 'Greenwashing' risk for your medical claims. You must choose: either strip the 'Flower Goddess' mythology to protect the clinical integrity (Option A), or soften the hard-science claims to fully embrace the 'Natural Healer' positioning (Option B). A surgeon does not bring a bouquet to the operating table."

    "evidence": "PDP: '3-4-5 formula contains 3 anti-inflammatory...' (Defined) vs. WWW: '345 Relief Cream' (Abstract)",
    "why_matters": "The PDP proves that customers crave the *technical logic* behind the name. The WWW is hiding the brand's smartest asset—the systematic formula structure—behind generic benefits. The '3-4-5' concept is a proprietary hook that is being under-leveraged on the direct channel.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon listing has cracked the code: people buy the 'System,' not just the cream. Your website is treating the '345' name as a random number rather than a structural promise. You must pivot: either adopt the PDP's 'Formula Education' strategy globally to own the 'Smart Skincare' space (Option A), or admit the number is too complex for the mass market and rename the product to 'Relief Cream' (Option B). Intelligence sells, but only if you explain it."
