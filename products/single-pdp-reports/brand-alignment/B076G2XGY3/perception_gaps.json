    "evidence": "[Functional Benefits] WWW: 'Restoration (The Fixer)' vs. PDP: 'Hydration (Maintenance)'",
    "why_matters": "This conflict confuses the customer on the product's core job. A user seeking intensive repair might dismiss the PDP, while a user looking for daily moisture might find the WWW's claims too aggressive. This gap creates consideration friction.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are selling two different outcomes. The market data from Amazon suggests 'daily hydration' is the volume play, but the brand's clinical heritage is rooted in 'repair.' You must decide: either re-engineer the website to embrace the softer 'daily maintenance' narrative (Option A), or discipline the Amazon channel to use the more aggressive 'clinical restoration' language and risk alienating the mass market (Option B). You cannot be both a cure and a prevention."

    "gap_description": "Stemming from the functional gap, the brand's core purpose is split. The WWW acts as 'The Healer,' here to medically correct a problem. The PDP acts as 'The Guardian,' here to scientifically protect you from one.",
    "evidence": "[Purpose] WWW: 'The Healer (Restoration)' vs. PDP: 'The Guardian (Maintenance)'",
    "why_matters": "A brand's purpose is its north star. This split dilutes the reason for being. Customers don't know whether to trust you for urgent care or for daily defense, weakening your authority in both domains.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand is suffering from a crisis of conscience. The 'Healer' persona feels authentic to your clinical roots, while the 'Guardian' persona is likely driving more sales on Amazon. The choice is stark: either lean into your heritage and force the PDP to adopt the 'Healer' positioning (Option A), or accept the market has spoken and pivot the entire brand purpose to being 'The Guardian' of healthy skin (Option B). A brand that tries to be both a doctor and a bodyguard is trusted as neither."

    "gap_description": "Both channels present a 'Guardian' archetype, but the emphasis is subtly different. WWW prioritizes The Sage (wisdom, expertise) over The Ruler (authority, control). PDP flips this, prioritizing The Ruler over The Sage.",
    "evidence": "[Archetypes Mix] Secondary Archetype: WWW (Sage), PDP (Ruler). Tertiary Archetype: WWW (Ruler), PDP (Sage).",
    "why_matters": "This is a minor but meaningful drift in personality. Does the brand lead with 'Here is our research' (Sage) or 'We are #1' (Ruler)? This nuance affects how customers perceive your authority—is it earned through wisdom or declared through dominance?",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand's personality is having a debate with itself. On Amazon, in a fiercely competitive environment, leading with dominance ('#1 brand') makes sense. On your own site, leading with wisdom ('110 years of expertise') builds deeper trust. You must decide: either amplify the 'Ruler' claims on your website to project more market power (Option A), or soften the 'Ruler' claims on Amazon to lead with the 'Sage's' wisdom, building a more profound connection (Option B). You must choose between being respected for your knowledge or revered for your power."

    "evidence": "[Self-Expression] Signal Driver Slider: WWW (1/5 The Tool) vs. PDP (2/5 The Smart Choice)",
    "why_matters": "This 'fragile health' suggests the WWW is under-selling its customer. Framing the purchase as just a functional 'tool' risks making the brand feel basic or thoughtless. The PDP's 'smart choice' angle credits the customer with more intelligence, which builds a stronger brand connection.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand home is subtly disrespecting its customer's intelligence. You face a clear choice: either elevate the self-expression narrative on your website to match the more sophisticated 'Smart Choice' framing on Amazon (Option A), or dumb down the Amazon positioning to be a simple 'Tool' to maintain absolute consistency (Option B). Selling a tool is a transaction; selling a smart choice is a relationship."

    "evidence": "[Mission & Vision] PDP uses powerful social proof metrics vs. WWW using a simple list of retailers.",
    "why_matters": "Your brand's own website is the conservative bottleneck, failing to leverage its most compelling proof of mass adoption and trust. The Amazon listing proves the power of this data in a competitive environment.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your marketplace page is outperforming your brand home at telling the same story. The choice is simple: either port the powerful social proof metrics from Amazon—like review counts and sales ranks—directly onto your WWW page to dramatically strengthen your argument (Option A), or continue to keep them separate and allow your own site to feel less authoritative than your Amazon presence (Option B). You have the proof, but you're only using it in one place."
