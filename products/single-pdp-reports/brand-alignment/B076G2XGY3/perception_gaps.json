    "why_matters": "This is the most critical question a customer has: 'What does this do?' By providing two different answers, you force them to guess. This leads to purchase hesitation for new users and potential disappointment for existing ones who might buy it for the wrong reason.",

Option A: Embrace the 'Restoration' narrative and update the Amazon page with stronger, clinical repair language, targeting users with problem skin.

    "why_matters": "The 'reason to believe' is unstable. Customers are unsure if they are buying a superior city-wide power grid or a precision tool for a single task. This conflict weakens competitive differentiation and pricing power because the source of value is undefined.",

Option A: Go all-in on being 'The Specialist' and rewrite the website to focus entirely on solving the problem of 'very dry skin.'

You must choose which emotional territory to own. Option A: Lean into 'Confidence' and rewrite the website to be about preparing for the day ahead. Option B: Double down on 'Relief' and change Amazon to focus on the feeling of sanctuary and at-home comfort. A brand must solve one emotional problem flawlessly, not two problems poorly."

    "why_matters": "This minor inconsistency creates a fragile balance. The hyper-clinical website risks feeling too cold and severe for a mass-market audience, while the more relaxed Amazon page could be seen as diluting the scientific credibility that is core to the brand's authority.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand lives on a knife's edge between the laboratory and the pharmacy shelf. This slight visual drift could tip the balance. Option A: Enforce the 'Clinical Sterile' standard on Amazon to maintain maximum scientific authority, even if it feels intimidating. Option B: Soften the website to match the 'Professional' tone of the marketplace, accepting that mass appeal requires a friendlier face.

    "evidence": "[Mission & Vision] PDP data (price, reviews, BSR) provides powerful, tangible evidence of the 'Democratic' mission that is only implied on WWW.",
