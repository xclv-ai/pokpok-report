    "evidence": "[Functional Benefits] WWW: 'Restoration (The Fixer 5/5)' vs. PDP: 'Hydration (Maintenance 3/5)'",
    "why_matters": "A customer seeking urgent repair (WWW promise) will see the PDP and feel it's just a standard moisturizer, losing the conversion. A customer looking for a simple hydrator (PDP promise) might be turned off by the intensity implied on the website.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are currently selling a prescription-strength solution on your website and an over-the-counter staple on Amazon. You must choose one identity.

    "why_matters": "The brand feels slightly more intimidating and less approachable on its own turf. The PDP has developed a more commercially palatable version of the brand's identity, suggesting the core brand guidelines are too rigid for the real world.",

    "why_matters": "This minor inconsistency can affect price perception. 'Clinical Sterile' can signal a higher, more justified price, while 'Professional' competes more directly with other consumer brands. The brand is slightly diluting its medical authority on the PDP.",

    "why_matters": "This high-performing area (90% alignment) is a hidden risk because there isn't a single, unified strategy on the most effective way to build trust. If market conditions change or a competitor attacks one method of proof, this could fracture.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are building trust with two different toolkits: showing proof on your site and stating proof on Amazon. This consistency is a hidden risk. Option A: Decide the 'Thesis' is stronger and re-tool the website to lead with expert quotes and clinical data. Option B: Conclude that visual 'Evidence' is more compelling and update the Amazon content to feature more before-and-afters. A single theory of proof is always stronger than two competing hypotheses."

Option A: Remove the specific '9/10' claim from Amazon to bring it back in line with the more conservative corporate messaging. Option B: Immediately adopt the '9/10 WOMEN CONFIRM' statistic on your website, recognizing that the marketplace team has found a more powerful way to convert customers.
