    "evidence": "[Functional Benefits] WWW: 'Restoration' (Action: 5/5 The Fixer) vs. PDP: 'Hydration' (Action: 3/5 Maintenance)",
    "why_matters": "This is the most dangerous kind of gap because it creates a fundamental mismatch in performance expectations. A user seeking a powerful repair lotion may be disappointed, while a user wanting simple hydration may be over-sold, leading to distrust and negative reviews.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand's soul is split between being a clinical treatment and a daily comfort. Option A: Upgrade the Amazon PDP to reflect the high-potency 'Fixer' language of the website, targeting users with acute needs and charging a premium. Option B: Tone down the 'Restoration' claims on the website to align with the simpler 'Hydration' promise on Amazon, capturing the broader daily-use market. You can't be both a hospital and a health spa; one promise will cannibalize the other."

    "why_matters": "This strategic wobble confuses the customer's purchase motivation. Is this product for when my skin is already in trouble (Healer), or is it a daily defense to prevent trouble (Guardian)? This lack of clarity weakens the brand's authority and complicates the path to purchase.",
    "the_hard_choice": "The brand is telling two different scientific stories: fixing what's broken versus protecting what's healthy. This indecision makes you a generalist in a specialist's world. Option A: Commit fully to the 'Healer' narrative, making Nivea the go-to for clinical repair. Option B: Commit to the 'Guardian' role globally, positioning the brand as the essential daily defense. A doctor who only does check-ups isn't a doctor for long, and a bodyguard who only shows up after the fight is useless."

    "why_matters": "The brand's innovation story is fractured. Is the hero the proprietary 'Deep Nourishing Serum' (WWW) or its specific application for a single ailment (PDP)? This prevents the brand from owning a clear, defensible competitive advantage, diluting its perceived expertise.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You're telling two different stories about your innovation. Are you a brilliant technology platform, or a perfectly targeted silver bullet? Option A: Embrace the 'Tech Engineer' story globally, marketing the 'Deep Nourishing Serum' as a versatile platform.

    "evidence": "[Positioning] Aesthetic Slider: WWW 1/5 (Clinical Sterile) vs. PDP 2/5 (Professional)",
    "why_matters": "This minor drift represents a hidden risk. It suggests the marketplace is independently evolving the brand to be more approachable, potentially at the cost of the absolute, sterile authority the core brand projects. If left unchecked, this could slowly erode the brand's core pharmaceutical positioning.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your identity as a Medical Authority is strong, but it's beginning to thaw on Amazon. You must decide on the brand's bedside manner. Option A: Enforce the stark 'Clinical Sterile' aesthetic on Amazon to maintain absolute, uncompromising scientific authority. Option B: Adopt the slightly warmer 'Professional' tone from Amazon across all channels, acknowledging that even experts must be approachable to build trust.

    "why_matters": "Your website is stating a fact, but your Amazon page is winning an argument. The PDP's use of live marketplace data is a masterclass in building trust and urgency, proving the brand is currently dominant, not just historically significant. The WWW is leaving conversion on the table by using weaker proof.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You've perfected the 'Safe Choice' message, but your own website is using a history book while Amazon uses a live stock ticker. The market has spoken: dynamic proof converts. Option A: Keep the website as a serene, historical brand museum, accepting lower conversion. Option B: Inject the high-velocity, competitive social proof from Amazon onto your website to prove your relevance is current, not just historical. Legacy earns respect, but momentum drives sales."
