    "gap_description": "The WWW site promises deep 'Restoration' for damaged skin, acting as a powerful fixer. The PDP dials this back significantly, offering standard 'Hydration' for daily maintenance. This creates a severe expectation gap.",
    "evidence": "[Functional Benefits] WWW: 'Restoration' (Action: 5/5 The Fixer) vs. PDP: 'Hydration' (Action: 3/5 Maintenance)",
    "why_matters": "A customer researching a 'fix' on your website who then buys a 'maintenance' product on Amazon will feel misled. This mismatch undermines your clinical authority and risks positioning your product as a basic commodity, not a targeted solution.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are promising a hospital-grade fix on your own turf but delivering a daily-use product in the marketplace. You must decide: either elevate the Amazon messaging to match the 'Restoration' promise of the website (Option A), risking unmet expectations, or tone down the website to reflect the more realistic 'Hydration' benefit (Option B), sacrificing a powerful clinical claim for omnichannel honesty. You cannot be a surgeon on one channel and a family doctor on another."

    "evidence": "[Archetypes Mix] WWW Secondary/Tertiary Mix: 'The Sage & The Innocent' vs. PDP Secondary/Tertiary Mix: 'The Ruler & The Sage'",
    "why_matters": "This shift confuses the customer about the brand's intent. Is NIVEA a gentle, trustworthy teacher that happens to be big? Or is it a dominant force that uses its size to command loyalty? This identity crisis weakens the emotional connection.",
    "the_hard_choice": "The soul of your brand is split. On your website, you are a gentle, wise teacher. On Amazon, you are a commanding king. The choice is stark: either lean into the 'World's #1' dominance narrative from Amazon and update the website to reflect a more assertive, Ruler-based identity (Option A), or discipline the Amazon page to tell the softer, more historical story of purity and wisdom (Option B). A brand can be a wise guide or a powerful king, but a brand that tries to be both is just a confusing politician."

    "evidence": "[USP] WWW Ownership Claim: 'The Proprietary System (5/5)' vs. PDP Ownership Claim: 'The Signature Complex (3/5)'",
    "why_matters": "On the world's largest marketplace, you are hiding your single greatest point of differentiation. This failure to communicate your true technological advantage makes you appear less innovative and more interchangeable with competitors.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your website claims a Nobel-level advantage with a 'Proprietary System' built over a century. Your Amazon page sells it like a secret recipe, a mere 'Signature Complex'. You are hiding your crown jewel. The hard choice is this: either invest in A+ content on Amazon to properly tell the 'Eucerit' engineering story (Option A), or concede that the marketplace doesn't reward deep science and simplify the website's USP to match the PDP's modest claim (Option B). You can't build an empire on a secret you refuse to tell."

    "evidence": "[Emotional Benefits] Self-Perception Axis: WWW 'Sanctuary (1/5)' vs. PDP 'Comfort (2/5)'",
    "why_matters": "'Sanctuary' is a profound, ownable emotional territory that builds fanatics. 'Comfort' is a transactional benefit that builds repeat customers. By simplifying the emotion on the higher-traffic channel, you risk slowly eroding your brand's soul and becoming a pure utility.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are dangerously close to perfect alignment, but a subtle drift threatens your brand's soul. Your website promises 'Sanctuary,' a deep feeling of safety. Amazon simplifies this to 'Comfort,' a more functional feeling. You must decide: either infuse the Amazon content with the more poetic language of 'Sanctuary' to deepen emotional connection (Option A), or accept the marketplace reality and simplify the website to focus on the more direct promise of 'Comfort' (Option B). A brand that sells comfort gets repeat purchases; a brand that sells sanctuary gets disciples."

    "the_hard_choice": "Your positioning as 'The Medical Authority' is a perfectly executed fortress of trust. The temptation in today's market is to chase trends for short-term excitement. So the choice is one of discipline: either you protect this consistency at all costs, doubling down on your clinical identity (Option A), or you deliberately introduce a small, controlled amount of variance to test a more aspirational positioning on one channel (Option B). Consistency builds trust, but evolution prevents extinction."
