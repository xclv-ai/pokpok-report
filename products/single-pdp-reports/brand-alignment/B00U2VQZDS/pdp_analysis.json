    "description": "Neutrogena executes the ultimate 'Medical Authority' strategy, transforming a commodity wipe into a piece of scientific equipment. By leveraging 'patented technology' and 'dermatologist recommended' badges, it creates a moat of safety that justifies its massive category dominance.

      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the Lab (The Healer), prioritizing clinical correction over sensory pleasure. Its value system is Safety First, explicitly trading 'harsh' potency for 'ophthalmologist tested' tolerance.

The Caregiver archetype dominates (60%) through relentless reassurance signals ('gentle,' 'safe,' 'tested'), while the Pharma-Code visual identity uses medical blue and grid layouts to reinforce a sterile, high-trust environment. The tone is The Clinical Authority: dry, precise, and academic."

      "description": "Messaging hooks on the Result ('Removes 99%') but persuades with Data, placing it in The Problem Solver territory. The USP is The Tech Engineer, claiming ownership through 'Patented Technology' rather than just ingredients. KSPs rely on Derm-Validation, using the 'Board' of doctors as the ultimate truth. The focus is Science Education, prioritizing diagrams over dreams."

The Emotional Benefit is Relief/Safety, selling the absence of irritation ('ophthalmologist tested'). Signals appeal to The Pragmatist who rejects hype, and the Social Benefit is The Safe Choice—joining the majority to avoid risk."
