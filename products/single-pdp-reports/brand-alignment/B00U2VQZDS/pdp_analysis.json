    "description": "Neutrogena acts as the default 'Blue Chip' stock of the skincare aisle. By wrapping a commodity product (wet wipes) in the armor of 'Patented Technology' and 'Ophthalmologist Testing,' it converts a utilitarian chore into a medical safety ritual. It relies on the crushing weight of social proof (#1 Best Seller, 116k reviews) and clinical validation to eliminate any need for the customer to think, feeling like the inevitable, pragmatic choice for the masses."

      "title": "The Problem Solver",
      "description": "Messaging hooks on the 'Result' (99% removal) backed by Derm-Validation logic. It avoids poetry in favor of 'The Graph'—clinical studies and percentages serve as the primary currency of trust. The focus is strictly Science Education, using diagrams of 'Patented Technology' to justify a mass-market purchase."
