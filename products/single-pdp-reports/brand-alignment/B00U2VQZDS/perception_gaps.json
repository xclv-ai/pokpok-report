    "the_hard_choice": "You are currently projecting conflicting psychological cues—one of dominance (Sage) and one of submission (Caregiver). The market needs to know if you are leading them or serving them. You must choose: either enforce the 'Sage' authority on Amazon to justify the premium (Option A), or soften the website to 'Caregiver' and accept a mass-market positioning (Option B).

Consistency on a weak claim is just consistently invisible."

The Amazon approach is less 'premium' but more 'human,' and it's working.

Perfection is pretty, but reality pays the bills."
