    "description": "Neutrogena executes 'The Clinical Standard' with ruthless consistency. By merging the sterility of the lab (Pharma-Code visuals, Derm-Validation) with the accessibility of the supermarket (The Democratizers), it eliminates the 'tax' on safety.

      "title": "The Medical Democratizer",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the clinic (The Guardian), focusing on maintenance and defense rather than radical transformation.

      "description": "The messaging strategy is The Problem Solver, targeting the 'makeup removal' job-to-be-done with rational precision. The USP is The Ingredient King, leveraging broad 'Micellar' recognition rather than proprietary mystique. Proof is delivered via Derm-Validation, using the 'Dermatologist Recommended' badge to silence skepticism."
