      "title": "Clinical Caregiver",
      "description": "The personality is a hybrid of The Reliable Expert and a supportive Caregiver, using a 'Clean, clinical' visual code (Pharma-Code) to signal safety.

The USP leans into The Tech Engineer territory by branding standard efficacy as 'Patented Technology' (Triple Emollient Blend). The Focus is balanced between Science Education (clinical hydration claims) and Commerce."
