The data demands a choice: either strip the 'Hype' from the website to secure the long-term medical prestige (Option A), or inject the 'Pop' into the Amazon listing to ride the short-term viral wave (Option B).

The choice is clear: either replace the ephemeral 'Cardi B' hero on WWW with the eternal '100 Million' stat to cement legacy status (Option A), or keep chasing the 'Newest Star' and risk fading when the trend dies (Option B). Trends fade; numbers don't."
