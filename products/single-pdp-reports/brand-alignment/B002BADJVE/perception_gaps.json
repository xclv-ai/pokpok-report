      "the_hard_choice": "You are trying to be both a democratic teacher and an absolute monarch, which is impossible. The data from your #1 Bestseller Rank on Amazon suggests the 'Ruler' is winning. Option A: Commit to the 'Guardian' archetype, rewriting the website to be more assertive, dominant, and focused on market leadership.

      "the_hard_choice": "Your brand's values are torn between what's in the bottle and what's not. The mass-market success on Amazon suggests the 'Safety First' message has a broader appeal. Option A: Pivot your website to lead with safety, making it the foundation for performance.

      "evidence": "[Narrative] Setting Slider: WWW 1/5 (Sterile) vs. PDP 2/5 (Tech-Forward)",
      "why_matters": "A brand's origin story is a core asset. This drift suggests the Amazon team is improvising to modernize the narrative, likely because it performs better. If left unmanaged, this will create a full-blown contradiction over time, diluting the brand's foundational myth.",
