The time has come to decide who you are: Option A is to commit to being the viral 'Trend-Setter' and inject the Cardi B and TikTok hype directly into the Amazon listing.

      "the_hard_choice": "Your brand's look and feel is suffering from a split personality. You must make a hard choice: either your brand is a high-energy pop cultural phenomenon, which means you must break Amazon's grid with expensive, dynamic creative (Option A), or it's a serious clinical authority, which means you must strip the 'dopamine' aesthetic from your website (Option B).

The choice is stark: either fully commit to this influencer-driven model and inject the specific Cardi B and TikTok assets into your Amazon content to maximize sales velocity (Option A), or retreat from this strategy on your website to create a more conservative, evergreen brand that is easier to manage but less potent (Option B). The market has already told you what works; the only question is whether you will listen."
