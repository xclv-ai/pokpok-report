Option A: Embrace 'The Chemist' on all channels, rebuilding the website as an educational hub that wins on ingredient authority. Option B: Enforce 'The Problem Solver' narrative on Amazon, leading with the emotional outcome of 'flawless skin' and demoting the ingredient specs to a supporting role. You have to choose whether you sell the story or the footnotes."
