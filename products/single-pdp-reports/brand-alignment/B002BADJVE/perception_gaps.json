    "evidence": "[ARCHETYPES MIX] WWW: 'The Sage' (truth, wisdom) vs. PDP: 'The Magician' (transformation, power).",
    "why_matters": "This is the soul of the brand. A customer doesn't know if they are buying from a trusted academic or a powerful performer. This confusion erodes the foundation of the brand relationship and what it stands for.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand's soul is split between promising truth (WWW's Sage) and promising miracles (PDP's Magician). Option A: Lean into the market's love for transformation, rewrite the website to celebrate the Magician's power, and accept you are selling results, not research. Option B: Discipline the Amazon page, remove the transformation hype, and build a long-term brand based on the Sage's authority and trust. A brand can be respected or it can be magic, but it is nearly impossible to be both at once."

    "evidence": "[FOCUS] WWW: 'Social Proof (Validation)' vs. PDP: 'Hard Product Sell (Commerce)'",
    "why_matters": "The customer journey is fractured. A user gets inspired on the website, then feels pressured by a hard sell on Amazon. This disconnect makes the brand feel less like a trusted partner and more like a transactional funnel.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are running two different businesses: a media company building a community (WWW) and a direct-response marketer driving sales (PDP). The hard choice is this: Does your growth come from community or conversion? Option A: Port the high-converting 'Hard Sell' tactics from Amazon to your website and admit you're built to sell, not just inspire. Option B: Bring the editorial 'Social Proof' feel to your Amazon content to build a consistent, trusted brand across all channels. You have to decide if you're building an audience or just a sales engine."

    "evidence": "[VISUAL IDENTITY] WWW: 'Pharma-Code (Cool, Structured)' vs. PDP: 'Earthy Organic (Hot, Structured)', which manifests as passionate performance.",
    "why_matters": "Visuals are the fastest signal of brand intent. Seeing a laboratory on one channel and a luxury sports car on another is jarring. It confuses the customer about the product's essence: is it safe and clinical, or bold and powerful?",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand aesthetic is torn between the dermatologist's office and the runway. Is this a medical solution or a statement piece? Option A: Embrace the high-performance red palette from Amazon and redesign your website to signal power and confidence. Option B: Force the Amazon page to conform to the clinical, 'Pharma-Code' standard to reinforce scientific authority, even if it feels less exciting. You cannot be both the sterile lab and the passionate force; one is diluting the power of the other."

    "evidence": "[MESSAGING] Both channels flawlessly execute 'The Problem Solver' territory, focusing on rational hooks and logical persuasion.",
    "why_matters": "The beauty market is driven by emotion. By being relentlessly functional, the brand risks becoming a commodity. A competitor could easily outflank Missha by selling a dream, not just a solution, making the brand feel dated and utilitarian.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your messaging is a perfectly rational, efficient engine, but efficiency doesn't build loyalty. The risk is that you're so good at solving a problem that you've forgotten to tell a story. Option A: Stick to the functional messaging that is clearly working and accept the risk of being commoditized by a more emotional competitor. Option B: Proactively evolve the messaging to introduce more aspirational elements, even if it breaks today's perfect consistency. You must decide if you're selling a tool or an identity."

    "evidence": "[KEY SELLING POINTS] PDP leverages hard data (sales volume, review count) while WWW uses celebrity/trend signals.",
    "why_matters": "Hard data builds lasting trust and authority more effectively than a celebrity endorsement. The brand's own website is under-leveraging its strongest proof points, making it appear less credible than its Amazon listing.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon page makes a more powerful, data-driven case for the product than your own brand home. The market responds to big numbers and overwhelming proof. Option A: Keep the 'cooler,' trend-focused approach on your website to preserve an editorial feel, at the cost of authority. Option B: Adopt the hard-data strategy from Amazon across all channels, making '100 Million Sold' the centerpiece of your brand identity. You must decide if your authority comes from being cool or from being chosen by everyone."
