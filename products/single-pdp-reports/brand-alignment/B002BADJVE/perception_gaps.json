    "why_matters": "A customer doesn't know if they are buying from a teacher or a king. This confusion undermines the reason to believe; one asks for trust through knowledge, the other demands it through authority. It creates a weak and unstable brand core.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are a brand without a soul, borrowing personalities for different occasions. You must decide if you are a university or a kingdom. Option A: Rebuild the website around the Ruler archetype, embracing your #1 status as the sole reason to believe. Option B: Strip the dominant 'Best Seller' rhetoric from Amazon and lean into the educational, evidence-based Sage. A brand that tries to be both a teacher and a tyrant is trusted by no one."

    "evidence": "[Values] WWW: 'Radical Transparency' (High-Performance/Spec Sheet) vs. PDP: 'Safety First' (Balanced/Explained)",
    "why_matters": "The expert user is underwhelmed by the PDP's simple safety messaging, while the cautious user is intimidated by the WWW's clinical complexity. By trying to be everything to everyone, you are optimized for no one and are likely losing conversions from both cohorts.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are selling to the chemist on your website and the concerned parent on Amazon. This bifurcation is killing your authority. Option A: Unify around performance and force the PDP to reflect the data-driven, 'Radical Transparency' of the WWW.

    "evidence": "[Personality] WWW: 'The Reliable Expert' (Distant/Specialist) vs. PDP: 'The Luxury Icon' (Pleasant/Deity)",
    "why_matters": "This personality shift confuses the customer's relationship with the brand. Are they interacting with a helpful guide who earns their trust, or an untouchable monarch who demands their loyalty? This erodes the believability of both personas.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Authority is earned through expertise or claimed through status, but rarely both. Your brand is toggling between the two, which reads as insecure. Option A: Inject the 'Luxury Icon' confidence into the WWW, fully embracing your market-leader status. Option B: Humanize the PDP by replacing status claims with the expert-led, educational tone of the WWW. A brand can be a teacher or a queen, but trying to be both just makes you a jester."

    "evidence": "[Narrative] WWW: Setting Slider (1/5 Sterile) vs. PDP: Setting Slider (2/5 Tech-Forward)",
    "why_matters": "The PDP's story is stronger, more modern, and more defensible. Over time, as the market gets more sophisticated, the WWW's generic narrative will look dated and weak, making the brand appear less innovative than it is.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your innovation story is consistent but showing signs of age on your own website. Option A: Standardize on the safe but uninspired 'sterile lab' narrative from the WWW. Option B: Embrace the proprietary tech language from the PDP and update the WWW, recognizing that brand stories, like technology, must evolve or die. A story about 'science' is table stakes; a story about *your* science is a moat."

    "evidence": "[Positioning] WWW relies on content signals ('Cardi B's Pick'). PDP uses container signals (bold red backgrounds, polished design).",
    "why_matters": "The PDP's execution is a more powerful, durable brand asset. The WWW is leaning on temporary trends, making its 'cool' feel borrowed. The Amazon presence proves the brand has the confidence to stand on its own design merit.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your positioning is perfectly aligned, but your own website is leasing its coolness while Amazon is owning it. Option A: Stick with the trend-based signals on WWW, accepting the risk that they become dated. Option B: Adopt the bold, design-forward visual system from the PDP onto the WWW, making your 'Clean Essentialist' vibe an intrinsic brand asset. Rented authority is fleeting, but an owned identity is forever."
