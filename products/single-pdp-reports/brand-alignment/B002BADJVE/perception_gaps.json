    "evidence": "[Archetypes Mix] WWW: 'The Insider' (Everyman/Jester) vs. PDP: 'The Philosopher' (The Sage/The Ruler)",
    "why_matters": "This is the root of the brand's schizophrenia. A consumer researching the product gets two completely different personalities, destroying trust. The fun, trendy signals on WWW feel hollow when faced with the clinical authority on the PDP, and vice-versa.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand is telling two different stories, and the audience is starting to believe neither. You must make a decision: Do you embrace the fun, populist energy of the 'Insider' and inject that personality into your Amazon content (Option A), or do you scrub the pop culture from your website and commit to being the serious 'Philosopher' you are on the marketplace (Option B)? A brand that tries to be everyone to everybody ends up being nothing to anyone."

    "why_matters": "Personality is the soul of the brand. This dramatic shift from approachable and trendy to distant and authoritative makes the brand feel inauthentic. Customers who meet the 'friend' on the website will be alienated by the 'doctor' on Amazon.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand's soul is for sale, and you are offering two different models. The time for hedging is over. Either rewrite the Amazon copy to reflect the warm, trend-aware 'Guide' from your website (Option A), or accept that the market demands an 'Expert' and re-engineer your website's personality to be more authoritative and less familiar (Option B). You can be a friend or a doctor, but a friendly doctor who suddenly gets cold is just unnerving."

    "evidence": "[Positioning] WWW: 'The Gentle Giant' (Polished/Daily Essential) vs. PDP: 'The Clean Essentialist' (Balanced/Elevated Everyday)",
    "why_matters": "This gap directly impacts price perception and customer expectation. 'Gentle Giant' signals reliable value, while 'Clean Essentialist' suggests a higher-priced, more discerning choice. This conflict confuses the customer about where you sit in the market, making them question your price point.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are straddling the line between the mass market and the masstige market, which is a notoriously dangerous place to be. You must choose your home: Is your brand's future in the high-volume, accessible world of 'The Gentle Giant' (Option A), requiring Amazon to adopt this positioning? Or is it in the more profitable, curated space of 'The Clean Essentialist' (Option B), requiring a significant premiumization of your website? The middle of the road is where brands go to die."

    "evidence": "[Values] WWW: 'Safety First' (Gentle) vs. PDP: 'Radical Transparency' (High-Performance)",
    "why_matters": "While the territory is different, the core issue is a mismatch in confidence. The Amazon page is making stronger claims about performance, likely because it has to compete more aggressively. This suggests your own website is leaving conversion on the table by being too timid.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon presence has evolved to be more assertive and performance-driven, likely out of necessity. The question is whether this is a bug or a feature. You can either tone down the 'High-Performance' claims on Amazon to match the 'Gentle' promise of the website (Option A), or you can recognize that the marketplace has taught you a valuable lesson and upgrade your website's messaging to be as confident as your PDP (Option B). Timidity doesn't win in a crowded market."

    "why_matters": "In a sea of schizophrenia, this perfect alignment is your anchor. It proves that no matter how the brand's personality shifts, the product's core value proposition is clear, understood, and consistently communicated by all teams. This is the foundation upon which a unified brand can be built.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You have accidentally proven that your product is stronger than your brand. Its functional promise of 'Correction' shines through despite the chaotic identity shifts. The hard choice is not one of opposition, but of amplification. Do you keep this functional benefit as a quiet, consistent hum beneath the noise (Option A), or do you elevate 'Correction' to be the hero of your entire brand story, rebuilding the fractured identity around this single, unwavering truth (Option B)? When your identity is broken, the strongest part of your product must become your new north star."
