    "description": "Missha masterfully executes 'Clinical Pop'—a strategy that merges serious skincare science (fermentation, SPF 42) with high-octane cultural relevance (Cardi B, TikTok). By pricing a '10-in-1' miracle product at $14.90, they act as the ultimate democratizers, proving that professional-grade K-Beauty doesn't require a premium budget. It feels like a pharmacy product that got famous on the internet."
