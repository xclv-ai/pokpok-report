    "the_hard_choice": "You are either a clinical authority or a relatable trendsetter; trying to be both makes you a confusing mess. The choice is binary: either embrace the warm, accessible 'Trendsetter' persona from the PDP and rewrite your website to match (Option A), or enforce the authoritative 'Reliable Expert' personality globally and strip the casual, friendly tone from Amazon (Option B). A brand cannot be both the professor and the cool older sister; one builds authority, the other builds community."

    "why_matters": "This conflict directly undermines your pricing power. A premium, 'insider' product commands a high price because of its perceived exclusivity. Broadcasting a 'bestseller' status on Amazon proves it is not exclusive, making the premium price on the website look like a ripoff.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand story is selling a secret, but your Amazon sales data is shouting it from the rooftops. You must choose one reality. Option A: Embrace your mass-market success. Update the WWW to celebrate your popularity, leveraging social proof as your primary asset. Option B: Protect the premium dream. Remove all 'bestseller' and high-volume signals from the PDP, and focus the messaging exclusively on the high-tech angle to justify the price. Exclusivity is a feeling, and every 'bestseller' badge makes it evaporate."

    "why_matters": "This creates a catastrophic price anchoring problem. A customer who sees the $15.84 Amazon price will never believe the 'Investment Piece' story on your website. This positioning schizophrenia trains your customers to see your brand as a cheap commodity, destroying your ability to command a premium.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are selling a Rolex on your website and a Swatch on Amazon. The customer knows they're both just watches and will default to the lower price. Option A: Commit to being an accessible luxury brand. Pivot the WWW to the 'Clean Essentialist' frame, celebrating the value and aesthetic. Option B: Commit to being a premium scientific brand. Align the Amazon price and messaging to the 'Scientific Miracle' position, sacrificing sales volume to protect brand equity. A brand's value is what the customer believes it's worth, and Amazon is currently telling them it's worth about sixteen dollars."

The WWW uses hard 'Raw Data' (clinical trials, user counts) as proof, while the PDP has softened the argument to simpler 'Rational' logic (ingredient stories). This is a subtle but dangerous dilution of your core authority.",

    "the_hard_choice": "Your messaging is consistent in what it promises but is drifting in how it proves it. This is how brand authority dies—not with a bang, but with a whisper of weaker evidence. Option A: Accept that the Amazon customer requires a simpler story, knowing you are sacrificing your deepest competitive moat for easier communication. Option B: Insist that all channels use the 'Raw Data' approach, making it the non-negotiable signature of your brand's credibility. A strong brand is a promise proven, not just explained."
