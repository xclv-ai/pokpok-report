The core conflict is a battle for the brand's soul: the WWW site sells a premium, clinical 'Scientific Miracle' while the Amazon PDP sells an accessible, lifestyle-oriented 'Clean Essentialist'."

Option A: Embrace the volume and re-platform the WWW site to reflect the accessible, masstige positioning that is likely driving growth on Amazon. Option B: Discipline the PDP, raising the price and rewriting the copy to reflect the premium, scientific positioning of the core brand.
