    "description": "Medicube executes a 'Clinical Pop' strategy that bridges the gap between a dermatologist's office and a TikTok feed. By combining rigorous pharmaceutical signaling (tables of clinical data, 'Dr. Shin' authority) with accessible K-Beauty aesthetics ('Glass Glow', pink tones), it positions itself as the 'Home-Clinic.' It feels like a medical prescription that you actually want to display on your vanity."

Content focus is Science Education, prioritizing diagrams and data over pure inspiration."
