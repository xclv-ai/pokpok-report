    "description": "Cliganic executes a ruthless 'Value Hacker' strategy, stripping away cosmetic romance to sell pure utility. By packaging a premium natural ingredient (Argan) in a bulk industrial format (16oz) under a clinically-coded brand name, it democratizes access to organic beauty. It plays the role of the wholesale supplier to the 'Smart DIY' consumer, proving safety through a wall of third-party certifications rather than brand storytelling."

      "title": "Certified Supply House",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in 'The Green Lab'—validating natural harvest with clinical rigor (USDA, Non-GMO). It positions itself as The Democratizer, offering 'Bulk Wholesale' access to ingredients typically gatekept by luxury pricing. The value system is Safety First, prioritizing 'Hypoallergenic' tolerance and 'Single Ingredient' purity over complex formulations."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Reliable Supplier",
      "description": "The personality is The Reliable Expert—distant, factual, and devoid of emotional fluff. Driven by The Innocent archetype (60%), it obsesses over purity ('100% Pure,' 'No synthetic additives'). The tone is Clinical Authority, speaking in specifications and certification lists rather than sentences."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "The Spec Sheet",
      "description": "Messaging is purely functional, acting as The Chemist who sells the noun ('Organic Argan Oil') rather than the dream. The USP is The Value Hacker, using bulk economics to undercut the category. KSPs rely on Formula Purity, using a checklist of 'Free-From' and 'Certified' logos as the ultimate proof of worth."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Pragmatic Maintenance",
      "description": "Functionally, it offers simple Hydration and Maintenance for 'dry skin' and 'brittle hair.' The emotional payoff is Relief/Safety—the peace of mind that comes from a 'Hypoallergenic' product. Socially, it is The Pragmatist's badge, signaling a rejection of marketing markup in favor of raw utility."
