    "description": "Terra Lotus anchors itself in the 'Personal Cure' narrative, where a mother's struggle with allergies birthed a natural solution. It democratizes the ancestral skincare trend (Tallow) by wrapping it in the safety of family ownership and massive social proof ('1,000,000+ Customers'). The brand feels like a protective, trusted neighbor who rejects modern chemicals in favor of nature's simple, time-tested pantry ingredients."

The Narrative is deeply personal, centering on the founder's journey from struggle to solution."
