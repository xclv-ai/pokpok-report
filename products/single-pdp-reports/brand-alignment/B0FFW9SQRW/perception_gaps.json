The hard choice is this: either delete the revolutionary manifesto from your website and own your success as a mainstream leader (Option A), or pull back from the mass market to preserve your 'High Priest' mystique and build a smaller, more fanatical tribe (Option B).

Option A: Commit to the 'Trendsetter' persona that's winning on Amazon and rebuild the website with warmer, family-oriented content.

Option B: Continue allowing other elements to contradict your positioning and watch as the cognitive dissonance erodes the price premium you currently command. Your one true north is your premium positioning; all other maps must be redrawn to follow it."
