You must choose: either flood the Amazon listing with the aggressive visual proof of the website to convert the desperate (Option A), or sanitize the website to focus on the 'Clean' ingredient list to capture the purist (Option B).

You must decide: either elevate the website experience to the 'Apothecary' standard of Amazon to justify a premium (Option A), or downgrade the Amazon aesthetic to the 'Family Utility' vibe of the site to drive volume (Option B).

The data demands a choice: either radicalize the website to match the 'Purist' exclusionary tone of Amazon (Option A), or soften the Amazon listing to welcome the 'Pragmatist' mass market (Option B). You can lead a cult or a category, but not both."
