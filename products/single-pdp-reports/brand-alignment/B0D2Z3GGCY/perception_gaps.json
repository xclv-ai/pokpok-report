While core identity markers like Positioning and Personality are consistent, the execution is schizophrenic, with 8 critical gaps in how the brand communicates its values, messaging, and purpose. The controlled WWW environment signals elite science, while the competitive PDP environment signals mass-market safety, creating profound customer confusion."
