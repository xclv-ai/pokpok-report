    "headline": "The Clinical Savior",
    "description": "La Roche-Posay Cicaplast is the emergency room for your skin barrier. It strips away all cosmetic vanity to function purely as a medical-grade tool for repair, validated by the overwhelming authority of '100,000 dermatologists.' It positions itself not as beauty, but as essential healthcare—safe enough for babies, effective enough for chemotherapy patients, and accessible enough for the daily vanity."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Medical Authority",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority entirely in the Clinical Lab, positioning itself as a Healer that treats skin pathologies rather than enhancing aesthetics. It operates under a Safety First value system, sacrificing potency or sensory pleasure to guarantee absolute tolerance for the most fragile users (babies, patients). The positioning is strictly Medical Authority—a white-coat staple found in the pharmacy, not the boudoir."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Sterile Caregiver",
      "description": "The distance between brand and user is defined by the 'Doctor-Patient' relationship. Dominated by The Caregiver archetype (60%) but expressed through the voice of The Sage (25%), it offers help through competence, not hugs. The visual identity is Pharma-Code—sterile white, medical blue, and Swiss-grid layouts that signal 'this is medicine.'"
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Clinical Education",
      "description": "The messaging uses a Rational persuasion logic, hooking the user with a specific 'Condition' (Cracked, Chafed) rather than a dream. The USP is The Specialist—owning the 'Healing Ointment' category for damaged skin. The focus is Deep Education, using diagrams of 'TribioMa' and ingredient panels to prove efficacy."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Biological Restoration",
      "description": "Functionally, it is The Fixer, aggressively repairing the biological barrier rather than just moisturizing. The emotional payoff is Reassurance—the removal of anxiety regarding skin health. Socially, it represents The Safe Choice, allowing the user to blend in with the 'Majority' who trust the gold standard of dermatological safety."
