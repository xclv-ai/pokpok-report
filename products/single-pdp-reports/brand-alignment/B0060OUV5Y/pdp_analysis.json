    "description": "La Roche-Posay's Cicaplast Balm B5 feels like a prescription you can buy without a doctor.

      "description": "The brand's purpose is explicitly to act as The Healer, anchoring its authority in dermatological validation, not nature, to fix skin problems. This is reinforced by its Safety First value system, prioritizing tolerance above all else, evidenced by claims like 'Baby Safe' and 'Allergy tested.' The strategy is to act as The Medical Authority, delivering a therapeutic-grade solution at an accessible, premium-drugstore price point, making professional-level care available to the masses."

      "title": "The Guardian Scientist",
      "description": "The brand maintains a significant distance from the user, behaving as The Reliable Expert rather than a peer. This is driven by its dominant Guardian archetype mix (Caregiver 60%, Sage 25%), which promises both protection and wisdom. This identity is perfectly mirrored in its Pharma-Code visuals—sterile, clinical, and serious—and its Clinical Authority tone of voice, which is dry, formal, and instructional."

      "description": "The brand hooks customers as a Problem Solver, focusing on the rational benefit of fixing irritated skin. Its unfair advantage is its position as The Specialist for this condition, leveraging a Lab Breakthrough narrative to build trust in its scientific origins. Key selling points are pure Derm-Validation, using the authority of '100,000 dermatologists' as the primary reason to believe, with a focus on Science Education through ingredient breakdowns."

This delivers an emotional benefit of Relief and Safety—the psychological payoff is the absence of worry and a return to comfort. The purchase is an act of self-expression for The Pragmatist, signaling a rational, no-nonsense choice. Socially, it's The Safe Choice, aligning the user with the majority who trust dermatological expertise."
