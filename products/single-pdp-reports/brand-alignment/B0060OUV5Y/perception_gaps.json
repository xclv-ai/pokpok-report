    "gap_description": "The WWW site presents the brand with absolute, unquestionable authority ('The Deity' 5/5). The PDP softens this slightly to a more approachable 'Specialist' (4/5) and adopts a colder, more 'Robotic' tone (1/5 vs. 2/5). This is a minor drift, not a conflict.",
    "evidence": "[Personality] WWW: 'Distant (2/5)' & 'The Deity (5/5)' vs. PDP: 'Robotic (1/5)' & 'The Specialist (4/5)'",
    "why_matters": "This subtle downshift in authority on the PDP might be a smart adaptation to the competitive marketplace, but it creates a slight crack in the brand's otherwise uniform armor of absolute expertise.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You have a choice between absolute and relative authority. Is the brand an unquestionable 'Deity' whose word is law, as on the WWW (Option A)? Or is it a more grounded, approachable 'Specialist' who earns trust in a competitive environment, as on the PDP (Option B)? One is a monument, the other is a tool; you must decide which one sells more cream."

    "gap_description": "The WWW site takes more time to explain the science behind the ingredients, positioning its information as 'Explained' (3/5). The Amazon PDP is more direct, presenting 'Evidence-First' (2/5) without the same narrative depth.",
    "evidence": "[Values] Information Density: WWW 'Explained (3/5)' vs. PDP 'Evidence-First (2/5)'",
    "why_matters": "This suggests an assumption that the Amazon shopper is more time-poor and needs facts faster, while the DTC visitor is more invested. This could be a smart channel adaptation, but it risks under-educating the Amazon buyer on the 'why'.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are deciding how much you need to teach. Does your authority come from deeply explaining the science to create educated loyalists, as on the WWW (Option A)? Or is it better to just state the facts and present evidence quickly for a faster conversion, as on the PDP (Option B)? A classroom builds disciples, but a billboard builds sales."

    "evidence": "[Visual Identity] Layout Control: WWW 'Swiss Grid (1/5)' vs. PDP 'Structured (2/5)'",
    "why_matters": "The DTC site's absolute rigidity signals ultimate clinical control. The slightly looser PDP format feels more native to the Amazon platform and may be more visually engaging for a scrolling user, representing a classic brand vs. platform tension.",
    "the_hard_choice": "This is a battle between brand purity and platform norms. Do you enforce the absolute, sterile rigidity of the 'Swiss Grid' across all channels to maintain perfect consistency (Option A)? Or do you adapt to the slightly more flexible, commercially-driven layouts of Amazon that might improve engagement (Option B)? A perfectly clean lab is impressive, but a well-organized workshop is where things get sold."

    "evidence": "[Tone of Voice] Formality Slider: WWW 'Traditional (2/5)' vs. PDP 'Academic (1/5)'",
    "why_matters": "This high-performing marker is strong, but the slight shift to a colder tone on Amazon could be the start of a drift where the brand voice becomes purely scientific, losing the institutional polish that builds broader trust.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your tone is exceptionally consistent, but a micro-fracture is forming. Do you maintain the slightly more polished, 'Traditional' corporate voice of the WWW to signal institutional trust (Option A)? Or do you double down on the 'Academic' voice of the PDP, embracing a purely clinical persona because that's what converts on a competitive shelf (Option B)? A respected institution writes the rules, but a published academic wins the argument."

However, the PDP makes a much stronger case by supplementing the 'dermatologist recommended' claim with powerful marketplace validation ('19,428 ratings', '#2 in Body Creams') that the WWW site completely omits.",
    "evidence": "[Self-Expression] PDP reinforces 'The Standard' with hard sales data (BSR, review counts) while WWW relies solely on expert claims.",
    "why_matters": "The WWW site is leaving its most powerful commercial proof on the table. It successfully argues that the product is the smart choice in theory, while the PDP proves it's the smart choice in practice, leveraging real-world data to close the deal.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon page is out-arguing your own website. You must decide on the true source of your authority: is it the pure, top-down declaration from dermatologists, as on your WWW (Option A)? Or is it the combination of expert opinion and undeniable, bottom-up validation from thousands of customers, which is powerfully converting on Amazon (Option B)? An expert's opinion is a hypothesis; a best-seller list is a law of physics."
