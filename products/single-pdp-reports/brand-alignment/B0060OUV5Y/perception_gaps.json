The Amazon PDP presents 'The Guardian' (using a 'Ruler' archetype), signaling top-down, authoritative control. You are a friend on your site and a doctor on Amazon.",
    "evidence": "[Archetypes Mix] WWW Tertiary: 'The Everyman' vs. PDP Tertiary: 'The Ruler'",
    "why_matters": "This conflict confuses the customer's relationship with the brand. 'Everyman' invites partnership, while 'Ruler' demands compliance. This schizophrenia weakens the brand's core motivation and emotional connection.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand's soul is split between approachable peer and unquestionable authority. You must choose one identity. Either lean into the 'Ruler' archetype on your website to command absolute authority across all channels (Option A), or pivot the Amazon strategy to reflect the 'Everyman' and build a community of equals (Option B).

    "evidence": "[Messaging] WWW Hook: 'The Component (2/5)' vs. PDP Hook: 'The Result (4/5)'",
    "why_matters": "The controlled environment (WWW) has higher cognitive friction than the competitive one (PDP). In a marketplace, benefits sell. The PDP's 'Result-first' approach is more commercially fluent and likely converts better.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your website is a science textbook while your Amazon page is a problem-solving tool. The data from the competitive environment suggests that leading with the solution is more effective. You must decide: either re-engineer your website to adopt the commercially-minded 'Result-first' messaging (Option A), or maintain the 'Science-first' approach to signal intellectual authority, even at the cost of conversion (Option B). One path leads to clarity, the other to the lab."

On PDP, the proof is 'The Stat'—what the product has passed ('Dermatologist tested', 'Allergy tested'), which signals clinical authority.",
    "evidence": "[Key Selling Points] WWW Proof Type: 'The List (4/5)' vs. PDP Proof Type: 'The Stat (2/5)'",
    "why_matters": "This split personality tries to appeal to two opposing value systems: the wellness trend-follower and the evidence-based pragmatist. By trying to be both, you risk losing the trust of the very consumers who rely on your clinical purity.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You're speaking two different languages of trust. The market demands you pick one. The choice is to either commit to the 'clean beauty' narrative by adding more 'free-from' claims to the PDP (Option A), or to strip the trendy checklist from your website and double down on the more defensible, authoritative clinical trial data (Option B). A brand built on science cannot hedge its bets on vibes."

    "evidence": "[Positioning] WWW Value Perception: 'Masstige (3/5)' vs. PDP: 'Daily Essential (2/5)'",
    "why_matters": "The 'Daily Essential' framing on Amazon, the point of highest volume, risks commoditizing the brand. Over time, this erodes the 'Masstige' price point and makes the product vulnerable to cheaper, private-label competitors.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon presence is subtly dragging your brand down from premium to pragmatic. This requires a strategic intervention. Either enforce the 'Masstige' signal on Amazon with more elevated A+ content to protect your price point (Option A), or accept the market's verdict, re-position the brand as the world's most reliable 'Daily Essential,' and prepare for a volume-based future (Option B). You're either a premium solution or a better commodity; the middle ground is a myth."

    "why_matters": "This sterile, serious voice is a beacon of trust. The risk is not in inconsistency, but that a future marketing initiative will try to 'humanize' or add 'personality' to the brand, which would instantly shatter the trust you've built.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your most powerful asset is your disciplined, boring voice. The hard choice is not about change, but about preservation. Either you codify this 'Clinical Authority' tone as a non-negotiable brand law and defend it against all future attempts to make it 'friendlier' (Option A), or you allow marketing to soften the edges for engagement, sacrificing your core differentiator for fleeting relevance (Option B). Authority is built on consistency, not personality."
