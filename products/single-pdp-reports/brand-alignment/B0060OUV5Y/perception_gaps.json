    "evidence": "[Narrative] WWW: 'The Green Lab' (Natural Harvest) vs. PDP: 'The Lab Breakthrough' (Sterile Lab)",
    "why_matters": "A brand's origin story is the foundation of its authority. Claiming to be both a gift from nature and a product of a sterile lab creates a contradiction that undermines trust in both narratives. Customers don't know if the magic is in the water or the test tube.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You have two competing souls: the romantic naturalist and the cold-hard scientist. You must kill one. The choice is binary: either lean into the 'thermal water' story from your website and inject that narrative into Amazon (Option A), or scrub the nature story from your website and go all-in on being a pure Lab Breakthrough brand (Option B).

    "evidence": "[Self-Expression] Signal Driver: WWW 'The Tool (1/5)' vs. PDP 'The Smart Choice (2/5)'",
    "why_matters": "Calling yourself a 'tool' undersells your value. The market is already framing your product as an intelligent decision. By not adopting this framing on your own site, you are failing to capitalize on a higher-value perception that your customers have already created for you.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your own site describes your product as a hammer, but the market perceives it as a strategic investment. You must decide if you will accept the promotion. Option A: Update your website to reflect the 'Smart Choice' signal, framing the purchase as an intelligent, consensus-backed decision. Option B: Keep your website purely functional and accept that it will always feel less sophisticated than your Amazon page. A tool is bought, but a smart choice is adopted."

    "evidence": "[Visual Identity] Entropy Scale: WWW 'Swiss Grid (1/5)' vs. PDP 'Structured (2/5)'",
    "why_matters": "Extreme minimalism can cross the line from 'clean' to 'empty.' While both channels are controlled, the PDP's structure tells a more compelling story. The WWW site's rigidity may signal control, but it sacrifices the ability to guide the user through a persuasive visual narrative.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your website is a sterile lab, while your Amazon page is a doctor's consultation—still clinical, but more communicative. The marketplace has forced a necessary evolution in your visual storytelling. The choice is simple: either update your DTC site to incorporate the more effective, structured layouts you're already using on Amazon (Option A), or leave it as a minimalist fortress that is less engaging than its marketplace counterpart (Option B). A grid signals control, but structure creates conviction."

    "evidence": "[Personality] Power Dynamic: WWW 'The Deity (5/5)' vs. PDP 'The Specialist (4/5)'",
    "why_matters": "The 'Deity' claim is powerful but extremely brittle. In a world of online reviews and social media callouts, one customer's unchanged life can shatter the illusion. The 'Specialist' claim is more resilient, building authority on expertise rather than miracles. The WWW site is writing checks the brand may not be able to cash.",
    "the_hard_choice": "On your own site, you claim to be a god; on Amazon, you are merely an expert. The 'Deity' claim is a high-risk, high-reward strategy that is dangerously fragile. You must make a choice: Do you double down on the god-complex across all channels and risk the backlash (Option A), or do you align the global brand personality to the more resilient and credible 'Specialist' posture (Option B)? Gods can be toppled, but specialists endure."

    "the_hard_choice": "The competitive environment of Amazon has forced your brand to become a better version of itself. It is a more potent 'Caregiver' in the marketplace than it is at home. The hard choice is this: Do you pull back the PDP to match the more conservative brand identity on your website (Option A), or do you admit the market has taught you something and dial up the 'Caregiver' intensity across all channels (Option B)? The market is telling you who you are; the only question is whether you are listening."
