    "why_matters": "This confuses the customer about the product's core promise: is it a powerful, high-strength treatment or a gentle, risk-free oil? Promising both erodes trust in its efficacy *and* its safety, pushing customers into a state of doubt.",

Option A: Update the PDP with the high-performance clinical data, accepting you may alienate the most cautious buyers.

Option A: Purge the 'natural oils' narrative from Amazon and double down on the 'proprietary laboratory' angle to align with the clinical Healer.

    "evidence": "[Tone of Voice] Formality Slider: WWW 2/5 (Traditional) vs. PDP 3/5 (Professional)",
    "why_matters": "This tiny gap is the canary in the coal mine for brand discipline. It suggests the Amazon/PDP team is improvising a voice that is likely higher-performing, while the core brand remains static. Over time, this improvisation can lead to significant brand personality drift.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand voice is beginning to fray at the edges. The market is likely rewarding the slightly warmer PDP tone, forcing a choice. Option A: Enforce a strict global style guide, pulling the PDP's tone back to the corporate 'Traditional' standard to maintain absolute control. Option B: Codify the higher-performing 'Professional' tone as the new global standard, accepting that the market has evolved faster than the brand book.

Option A: Preserve this consistency as the primary anchor of trust, the stable foundation upon which the entire brand rests. Option B: Use this consistent visual 'canvas' as a safe space to test bolder messaging and more aggressive claims, knowing your visual identity will hold the brand steady.
