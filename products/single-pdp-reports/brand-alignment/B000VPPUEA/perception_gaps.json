The data demands a choice: either embrace the 'Viral Miracle' status and drop the white coat posturing (Option A), or commit to 'Dermatological Rigor' and stop using volume as a proxy for quality (Option B).

You face a strategic ultimatum: either downgrade the Amazon listing to a simple sales pitch to match the velocity of the site (Option A), or upgrade the website to an 'Educational Hub' to justify the brand's premium claims (Option B).
