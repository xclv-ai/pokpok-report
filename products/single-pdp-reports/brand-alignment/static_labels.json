---
## B. THE 4 DIMENSION SUMMARIES

- VALUE PROP: 2 words describing offer (e.g., "Sensory Masstige")
- POSITIONING: 2 words describing market slot (e.g., "Joyful Staple")
---
## D. GOLD STANDARD EXAMPLES
Use these as your guide for tone and length.
Important! Do not use examples for actual output, always rephrase each time.

**FOUNDATION Example:**
The Natural Empowerer. The brand rejects clinical sterility to position itself as an Empowerer, anchoring its authority in the garden (Shea) rather than the lab while pursuing elevation, not repair. It balances this nature-focus with a Safety First value system, ensuring tolerance for sensitive skin. The strategy is pure Masstige—delivering a high-end sensory upgrade at a democratic price point.
**IDENTITY Example:**
The Hype-Beast Lover. There is zero distance between brand and user; it feels like a text message from a BFF. Dominated by The Lover archetype (65%), it uses high-warmth Gen-Z Pop visuals to seduce the senses. The voice is a Hype Beast, constantly enthusiastic ('Obsessed!') and using slang to build an intimate peer-to-peer bond.
**COMMUNICATION Example:**
Sensory Persuasion. The messaging bypasses rational data to sell Pure Vibes and The Dream. The USP is a Value Hack—delivering a high-end sensory experience via a Hero Ingredient (Shea). The narrative turns the routine into a Ritual, focusing on Editorial inspiration to trigger desire over education.
**BENEFITS Example:**
Low-Risk Contentment. While functionally acting as a Healer (Hydration), the true payoff is Emotional Contentment (Anxiety reduction). Socially, it offers Normalization (The Safe Choice) while allowing the user to signal they are a Trend-Setter—proving they are "in the know" without taking a financial risk.
