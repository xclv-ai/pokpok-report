# SUMMARY OF REPORT: THE 4 DIMENSION SUMMARIES

version 1.4 Jan 11 2026

You must generate these summaries using a strict "Data Synthesis" recipe. Do not just describe the page; connect the strategic dots by referencing actual Territory Names and Position Names from your marker analysis.
---
## A. OVERALL PERCEPTION SUMMARY
**Headline:** 3 Words capturing the brand's core positioning (e.g., "The Sensual Democratizer")
**Description:** 3-4 sentences synthesizing the overall brand perception. Answer: What does this brand FEEL like? How does it differentiate from competitors? What role does it play in the customer's life?
---
## B. THE 4 DIMENSION SUMMARIES
### 1. FOUNDATION (Purpose, Mission, Values, Positioning)
**Headline:** 3 Words (e.g., "The Gentle Democratizer")
**The Recipe (4 Sentences):**
1. The Stance: Define the brand's relationship to authority (reference Purpose territory)
2. The Balance: Connect Purpose to Values (reference Values territory)
3. The Strategy: Name the Positioning territory and price tier
4. The Payoff: The result for the user

2. The Driver: Cite the Dominant Archetype + percentage from Archetypes Mix
3. The Look: Connect Personality territory to Visual Identity territory
4. The Voice: Define the Tone of Voice territory + contrast to alternatives
### 3. COMMUNICATION (Messaging, Narrative, USP, KSP, Focus)

2. The Edge: The USP territory + what makes it unfair
3. The Origin: The Narrative territory + trust anchor

2. The Feeling: The Emotional Benefits territory + psychological payoff
3. The Signal: Self-Expression territory + what it says about the user
4. The Badge: Social Benefits territory + tribal membership

## C. QUICK LABELS
Generate 4 two-word labels that capture the brand essence at a glance:
- BRAND VOICE: 2 words describing tone (e.g., "Playful Bestie")
- VISUAL APPEAL: 2 words describing aesthetic (e.g., "Dopamine Pastels")
- VALUE PROP: 2 words describing offer (e.g., "Sensory Masstige")
- POSITIONING: 2 words describing market slot (e.g., "Joyful Staple")
---
## D. GOLD STANDARD EXAMPLES
Use these as your guide for tone and length.
Important! Do not use examples for actual output, always rephrase each time.

**FOUNDATION Example:**
The Natural Empowerer. The brand rejects clinical sterility to position itself as an Empowerer, anchoring its authority in the garden (Shea) rather than the lab while pursuing elevation, not repair. It balances this nature-focus with a Safety First value system, ensuring tolerance for sensitive skin. The strategy is pure Masstige—delivering a high-end sensory upgrade at a democratic price point.
**IDENTITY Example:**
The Hype-Beast Lover. There is zero distance between brand and user; it feels like a text message from a BFF. Dominated by The Lover archetype (65%), it uses high-warmth Gen-Z Pop visuals to seduce the senses. The voice is a Hype Beast, constantly enthusiastic ('Obsessed!') and using slang to build an intimate peer-to-peer bond.
**COMMUNICATION Example:**
Sensory Persuasion. The messaging bypasses rational data to sell Pure Vibes and The Dream. The USP is a Value Hack—delivering a high-end sensory experience via a Hero Ingredient (Shea). The narrative turns the routine into a Ritual, focusing on Editorial inspiration to trigger desire over education.
**BENEFITS Example:**
Low-Risk Contentment. While functionally acting as a Healer (Hydration), the true payoff is Emotional Contentment (Anxiety reduction). Socially, it offers Normalization (The Safe Choice) while allowing the user to signal they are a Trend-Setter—proving they are "in the know" without taking a financial risk.
