    "why_matters": "The website feels colder and more distant, potentially alienating the anxious mother or cancer patient who needs reassurance, not just a graph. The Amazon page is converting better because it speaks to the emotional need for safety, not just the intellectual need for proof.",

    "evidence": "WWW: 'The Green Lab' (Optimization) vs. PDP: 'The Lab Breakthrough' (Intellectual)",
    "why_matters": "The 'Green' angle on the site is a legacy artifact of the French pharmacy positioning that Amazon has proven is unnecessary. By clinging to the 'Thermal Water' romance on the site, you dilute the 'Hard Science' proposition that is winning on the shelf.",
    "the_hard_choice": "The market is buying your chemistry, not your geography. The Amazon listing proves that 'Sterile' sells better than 'Natural' for this specific audience. You face a choice: kill the thermal water romance on the site to own the 'Biotech' position fully (Option A), or force the nature story onto Amazon and dilute the medical authority (Option B).

    "the_hard_choice": "You have built a brand on complexity. This works for the 'Sage' but alienates the 'Simpleton.' You must choose: double down on the 'AP+M' education and accept you will never capture the low-attention shopper (Option A), or simplify the primary claim to 'Microbiome' and relegate the acronyms to the fine print (Option B).
