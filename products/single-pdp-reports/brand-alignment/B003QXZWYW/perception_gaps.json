    "evidence": "[USP] WWW Territory: 'The Tech Engineer' vs. PDP Territory: 'The Specialist'",
    "why_matters": "This split personality confuses the sophisticated shopper. Are they buying a piece of advanced engineering or a targeted solution from a diagnostician? This hesitation allows competitors with a simpler, more confident claim to win the conversion.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are currently both Intel, selling the processor inside, and the doctor writing the prescription. You must choose one identity. Option A: Lean into the Amazon 'Specialist' positioning globally, focusing all messaging on diagnosing and solving one high-pain problem.

    "evidence": "[Narrative] WWW Territory: 'The Green Lab (Optimization)' vs. PDP Territory: 'The Lab Breakthrough (Intellectual)'",
    "why_matters": "A brand's origin story is its soul. Is this product born from ancient springs enhanced by science, or created entirely within a modern lab? This contradictory mythology fractures authenticity and weakens trust in the brand's source of power.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are telling two different creation myths, one about perfecting nature and the other about conquering it. The market demands a single bible. Option A: Commit to the 'Lab Breakthrough' story from Amazon, positioning La Roche-Posay as a pure, cutting-edge biotech firm. Option B: Inject the 'Green Lab' narrative into Amazon, making the Prebiotic Thermal Water the sacred source of power. A brand without one clear origin is just a commodity in a bottle."

    "evidence": "[Mission & Vision] WWW Slider (Scope): '1/5 Micro-Correction' vs. PDP Slider (Scope): '2/5 Optimization'",
    "why_matters": "This ambiguity dilutes the brand's laser-sharp medical focus. It risks alienating the core user who needs a specialist for a serious condition, not a generalist for everyday improvement. The brand's authority is rooted in the clinic, not the spa.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your home base is an emergency room, but your Amazon embassy is a health spa. This drift is dangerous. Option A: Discipline the Amazon copy to focus exclusively on pathological terms like 'eczema' and 'barrier repair,' securing your medical niche. Option B: Evolve the website to embrace 'skin health optimization,' signaling a strategic pivot from treatment to daily wellness.

    "evidence": "[Positioning] Value Perception Slider: WWW 3/5 ('Masstige') vs. PDP 2/5 ('Daily Essential')",
    "why_matters": "This is a slow-motion erosion of brand equity. The 'Daily Essential' perception on the high-volume Amazon channel anchors the brand's value lower, making it harder to justify premium pricing or future innovations. It trains the customer to see you as a commodity.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand's clinical look is consistent, but what it's worth is not. This inconsistency will always resolve to the lowest price in the customer's mind. Option A: Revise Amazon's content to add premium cues and justify a 'masstige' price signal, protecting your brand equity. Option B: Accept that you are a 'daily essential' in the marketplace and adjust the website's tone to be more utilitarian. A brand that feels expensive in one store and cheap in another will always be judged by its discount."

    "why_matters": "Your most competitive channel is proving that a more confident, knowledge-driven voice resonates more strongly with customers. The brand's own website is the bottleneck, playing it too safe and leaving performance on the table.",
    "the_hard_choice": "The data from the front lines is clear: a more dominant Sage sells better. Your brand home is the only thing holding you back. Option A: Force the Amazon team to dial back their successful strategy to match the more cautious global standard. Option B: Recognize that the market has validated a bolder voice and update the global brand guidelines to make the 65% Sage the new, more confident standard. The professor on your website is tenured and safe; the one on Amazon is winning awards."
