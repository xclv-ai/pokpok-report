The choice is stark: either enforce the cold, hard 'Raw Data' approach everywhere to maintain absolute clinical authority at the risk of losing customers who need more guidance (Option A), or acknowledge the market needs more hand-holding and shift the global strategy to a more 'Rational,' explanatory approach (Option B).
