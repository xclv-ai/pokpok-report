    "gap_description": "The WWW signals it is a source of knowledge (Sage-led 'Philosopher'). The PDP signals it is a source of protection (Caregiver-led 'Guardian'). The brand is either a wise teacher or a nurturing protector, and this confusion strikes at its very soul.",
    "evidence": "[Archetypes Mix] WWW: Primary 'The Sage' (70%) vs. PDP: Primary 'The Caregiver' (65%)",
    "why_matters": "This is the core motivation of the brand. A Sage sells truth and data; a Caregiver sells safety and empathy. Confusing them dilutes the emotional promise and makes the brand feel opportunistic rather than authentic.",
    "the_hard_choice": "The brand's soul is a battlefield. Option A: Embrace the PDP's 'Guardian' persona, rewriting the website to lead with protection and empathy, becoming the ultimate skincare savior. Option B: Enforce the WWW's 'Philosopher' identity, scrubbing the emotional 'Caregiver' language from Amazon to be an unimpeachable source of clinical truth. You can be a doctor or a mom, but trying to be both at once creates mistrust."

    "gap_description": "The website hooks you by promising a functional outcome ('The Problem Solver'). Amazon hooks you by naming the scientific ingredients ('The Chemist'). This is a fundamental disagreement on what the customer values more: the 'what' or the 'how'.",
    "evidence": "[Messaging] WWW Hook Target: 'The Result' (4/5) vs. PDP Hook Target: 'The Molecule' (1/5)",
    "why_matters": "This schism targets two different buyer mindsets—one looking for a quick fix, the other for scientific proof. By trying to be both, you fail to build a strong, memorable argument with either, weakening your persuasive power.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your sales pitch has a split personality. You must decide who your customer is: the patient who wants the pain to stop, or the researcher who needs the clinical data. Option A: Commit to the PDP's 'Chemist' strategy, updating the website to lead with ingredients and science to win the informed consumer. Option B: Standardize on the WWW's 'Problem Solver' approach, removing jargon from Amazon to provide a clear, simple promise of results. You can sell the cure or the chemical, but not at the same time."

    "evidence": "[USP] WWW Ownership Claim: 'The Proprietary System' (5/5) vs. PDP Ownership Claim: 'The Signature Complex' (3/5)",
    "why_matters": "This gap erodes the brand's defensible moat. A 'Proprietary System' justifies a premium and builds deep loyalty. A 'Signature Complex' is just marketing speak that sounds like every other brand, inviting price comparisons.",
    "the_hard_choice": "The source of your uniqueness is being debated internally. Is your 'Microbiome Science' a true patented platform or just a branded ingredient story? Option A: Embrace the PDP's simpler approach, re-framing the website to talk about a powerful 'signature formula' that is easier for a mass audience to understand. Option B: Force the PDP to adopt the WWW's high-science 'Proprietary System' language, sacrificing some clarity to defend your premium, specialist positioning. A patent is a fortress; a good recipe is just an invitation for competitors to copy you."

    "gap_description": "The brand is almost perfectly aligned on its clinical tone, but the Amazon page allows a hint more levity ('Serious' 2/5) than the website's purely 'Grave' (1/5) tone. This tiny crack is where brand personality begins to erode.",
    "evidence": "[Tone of Voice] Humor Slider: WWW 1/5 (Grave) vs. PDP 2/5 (Serious)",
    "why_matters": "A clinical brand's authority rests on absolute consistency. This minor drift suggests the Amazon team may feel pressure to be more 'human' to sell, a temptation that, if followed, will slowly dilute the brand's core 'medical authority' positioning.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are holding a nearly perfect line on your clinical voice, but a minor deviation on Amazon hints at a future problem. Option A: Standardize on the slightly more approachable 'Serious' tone from the PDP, accepting that a mass marketplace requires a touch more warmth. Option B: Force the Amazon copy to be as 'Grave' and humorless as the website, preserving absolute clinical purity at the risk of appearing overly sterile. Even a small crack in a dam can lead to a flood."

    "evidence": "[Social Benefits] WWW relies on authority claims, while PDP adds hard data like Sales Rank and Review Count to validate its position.",
    "why_matters": "Your website is leaving your most powerful sales tool—market dominance—on the table. You are asking customers to trust your word on your own site, when the market has already voted with its wallet on Amazon.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your marketplace page is doing a better job of selling your product than your own brand website. The choice is stark: Option A, maintain the clinical purity of the WWW by keeping commercial social proof off the page. Option B, import the powerful social proof from Amazon (bestseller ranks, review counts) onto your DTC site to dramatically increase conversion. Authority is what you claim to be; power is what the market says you are."
