      "title": "The Clinical Sage",
      "description": "The brand maintains a deliberate psychological distance, behaving as a Reliable Expert rather than a peer. This is driven by its primary archetype, The Sage (65%), which seeks and delivers truth through 'Microbiome Science'. The look is pure Pharma-Code—sterile, trustworthy, and scientific—while the voice is a Clinical Authority, using academic and dry language to build trust through precision, not personality."

      "description": "The messaging strategy is that of a Problem Solver, hooking the user with the promise of a rational fix ('Triple Repair') for a specific pain point. Its USP as The Specialist for dry, eczema-prone skin is anchored in the narrative of a Lab Breakthrough, where trust comes from scientific discovery. Consequently, the page's Focus is on Science Education, prioritizing clinical proof and data over lifestyle inspiration."

The emotional payoff is one of Relief and Safety, removing the anxiety of skin irritation rather than adding cosmetic joy. This positions the purchase as a signal of a Pragmatist identity—someone who values science over hype. Socially, it's The Safe Choice, confirming the user's membership in the tribe of informed patients who trust dermatologists."
