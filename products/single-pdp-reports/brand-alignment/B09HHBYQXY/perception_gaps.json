    "why_matters": "This confuses the use case. If it's for 'everyday' (WWW), healthy people buy it. If it's for 'healing' (PDP), only injured people buy it. You are splitting your total addressable market.",

    "evidence": "WWW: 'Teen Safe... Baby Safe' (Safety) vs. PDP: '100% petrolatum... Drug Facts' (Science)",
    "why_matters": "Inconsistency in validation erodes authority. The anxiety-prone shopper (WWW) feels soothed, but the logic-prone shopper (PDP) feels patronized. When they cross channels, the 'Safe' brand looks weak and the 'Scientific' brand looks scary.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are oscillating between pandering to fear and asserting facts. You must choose: either strip the 'Free-from' fear-mongering from the site to establish absolute clinical dominance (Option A), or rewrite the Amazon listing to prioritize 'Safety' and capture the anxious parent demographic (Option B).

    "evidence": "Mission Scope: WWW 'Optimization' (2/5) vs. PDP 'Micro-Correction' (1/5)",
    "why_matters": "This impacts frequency of use. An optimization product is used daily. A correction product is used only when things go wrong. The inconsistency muddies the recurring revenue potential.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are treating the product as a daily habit on the site but a rescue remedy on Amazon. To maximize LTV, you must decide: either downgrade the site's promise to 'Fixing' to match reality (Option A), or upgrade the Amazon claim to 'Maintenance' to drive daily usage (Option B).

    "why_matters": "Consistency is good, but consistent boredom is fatal. Being purely functional works for a monopoly, but as 'Amazon Basics', you need just enough personality to be chosen over the name brand, not just tolerated.",

You face a strategic choice: either double down on 'Robotic Efficiency' to own the absolute bottom-dollar commodity slot (Option A), or inject a pulse of 'Smart Wit' to position the brand as the clever hacker's choice (Option B).

The choice is: continue to humbly suggest the comparison (Option A), or aggressively campaign on the 'Brand Tax' you are saving the customer (Option B). In a recessionary environment, 'Cheap' is an insult, but 'Smart' is a badge of honor."
