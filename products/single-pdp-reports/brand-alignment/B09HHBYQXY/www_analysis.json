    "headline": "The Utility Algorithm",
    "description": "Amazon Basics strips away all brand romance to offer pure, unadulterated utility. It feels like the infrastructure of commerce itself—reliable, efficient, and devoid of ego.

The USP is The Value Hacker—explicitly inviting comparison to name brands ('Compare to Vaseline') to prove equivalence at a lower price. Content focus is a Hard Product Sell, prioritizing transaction speed over education."
