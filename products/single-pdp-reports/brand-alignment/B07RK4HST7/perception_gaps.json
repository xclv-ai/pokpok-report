Option A: Force the PDP to adopt the simpler 'Problem Solver' message to maximize accessibility.

    "why_matters": "Massive brand equity is being created on Amazon that the DTC site is completely ignoring. This signals that the brand either doesn't understand its own cultural relevance or is afraid of it. You are leaving brand energy and influence on the table.",

Option A: Embrace the Amazon 'Ruler' archetype, update the website to be more declarative, and own your #1 position with dominance.

    "why_matters": "This is a hidden risk. While consistent now, a future product launch could expose this gap. A complex new ingredient might be 'explained' on WWW but demand hard 'evidence' on PDP, creating a trust deficit where one channel looks less transparent than the other.",

Option A: Commit to being 'Evidence-First' everywhere, requiring clinical data and diagrams on the DTC site to match Amazon's rigor. Option B: Commit to being 'The Explainer,' simplifying the science on Amazon to match the accessible narrative on the website.
