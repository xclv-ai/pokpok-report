    "description": "CeraVe feels like a medical-grade tool, not a cosmetic indulgence. It has successfully positioned itself as the foundational, non-negotiable first step in any serious skincare routine, stripping away all fragrance, emotion, and hype to deliver pure, clinical efficacy. Its role is to be the reliable, boring, and utterly essential utility that makes everything else work better."

This is built on a core value system of Safety First, where tolerance is prioritized over aggressive potency.

      "title": "The Clinical Expert",
      "description": "There is a significant and deliberate distance between the brand and user; it communicates with the sterile precision of a lab report. Dominated by The Sage archetype (65%), its personality is a Reliable Expert that eschews warmth for competence. This is perfectly mirrored by a cold, gridded Pharma-Code visual system and a Clinical Authority tone of voice that is academic and dry."

Its unfair advantage is its USP as a Tech Engineer, owning the MVE Delivery System. The narrative is a classic Lab Breakthrough, and the page's Focus is pure Science Education, designed to teach the mechanism, not inspire desire."
