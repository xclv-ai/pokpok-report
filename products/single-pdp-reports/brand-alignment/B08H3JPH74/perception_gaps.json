However, a critical drift exists between the corporate conscience (Green/Safe) on the website and the viral reality (Cosmic/Performance) on the marketplace, creating a brand that feels bipolar: a responsible citizen at home, but a hype-fueled party animal in public."

The data demands a choice: either purge the 'Conscious Together' crusade from the brand header to align with the mass-market reality (Option A), or force the Amazon listing to lead with 'Bio-Based' benefits and risk killing the conversion rate of a cheap essential (Option B).
