    "evidence": "[VISUAL IDENTITY] WWW: 'Clinical Pop' (Temp 4/5) vs. PDP: 'Dark Cosmic' (Temp 2/5)",
    "why_matters": "This is a bipolar visual experience. Customers clicking through from a 'Clinical' site to a 'Cosmic' Amazon page will feel they have entered a different brand universe, eroding the premium 'Lab' authority Maybelline tries to maintain.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are currently split between a sterile clinic and a midnight party. The physics of branding require a single atmosphere: either sanitize the Amazon presence to match the clean, professional 'Lab' authority of the site (Option A), or surrender to the 'Cosmic' energy and redesign the website to reflect the dark, viral intensity that is driving sales (Option B). You cannot be both the doctor and the DJ."

    "gap_description": "On WWW, the USP is 'The Tech Engineer,' focusing on the delivery mechanism and category breadth (Scope 3/5). On PDP, the USP shifts to 'The Value Hacker,' framing the product as a massive bargain (Scope 1/5). One sells innovation; the other sells a steal.",
    "evidence": "[USP] WWW: 'Category Player' (3/5) vs. PDP: 'Price Leader' (1/5)",
    "why_matters": "When you frame the product purely as a 'Price Leader' on Amazon, you commoditize the 'Tech' you spent millions developing. It trains the customer to buy only because it's cheap, not because it's better.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are caught between building brand equity and moving volume. You must decide: either strip the aggressive low-price signaling from Amazon to protect the 'High-Tech' aura (Option A), or accept that this is a volume commodity game and reframe the website to celebrate the 'Hack' of getting a $30 look for $10 (Option B). Prestige pricing requires prestige signaling everywhere."

    "evidence": "[EMOTIONAL BENEFITS] WWW: 'Confidence' (Feel Ready) vs. PDP: 'Intelligence' (Feel Smart)",
    "why_matters": "The emotional hook is confused. If the user buys for 'Readiness' but receives 'Savvy,' the brand connection remains shallow. You are trading deep emotional loyalty for transactional satisfaction.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are selling two different dopamine hits. You must choose the primary emotional driver: either focus globally on the transformative feeling of 'Readiness' to build a beauty bond (Option A), or double down on the 'Savvy Shopper' narrative and market the product as a tool for the smart consumer (Option B). A brand can be a lover or a life-hack, but rarely both."

    "evidence": "[TONE OF VOICE] Enthusiasm Slider: WWW 4/5 (Excited) vs. PDP 5/5 (Hype)",
    "why_matters": "Sustained maximum hype creates fatigue. The Amazon page risks sounding like a carnival barker, which undermines the 'Ophthalmologist Tested' safety claims that are crucial to the brand's 'Safe Choice' territory.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon listing is hyperventilating. While it grabs attention, it risks looking desperate compared to the website's confident composure. You face a choice: either discipline the Marketplace copy to speak with the controlled authority of a market leader (Option A), or unbutton the global voice to match the frantic energy of the viral internet (Option B). Authority is often quiet; desperation is always loud."

    "evidence": "[SELF-EXPRESSION] Signal Driver: PDP (4/5 Statement) > WWW (3/5 Balance)",
    "why_matters": "The PDP is tapping into a higher-order motivation—status. By framing the item as a 'Cosmic' totem, it likely drives higher desire than the utilitarian framing on the direct site.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon page has accidentally discovered that your product is a badge of cool, while your website still thinks it's just mascara. The data suggests a pivot: either keep the website 'Practical' to avoid alienating the basics (Option A), or upgrade the global identity to 'The Totem' and sell the product as a mandatory accessory for the culturally relevant (Option B). Utility sells, but identity sells at a premium."
