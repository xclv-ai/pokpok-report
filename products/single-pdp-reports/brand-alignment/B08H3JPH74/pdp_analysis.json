    "description": "Maybelline Sky High operates as a 'Viral Gravity Defier,' successfully democratizing high-performance lash technology (Flex Tower Brush) wrapped in a hyper-relevant 'Cosmic' aesthetic. It balances the aggression of Magician-style transformation claims ('Limitless Length') with the safety of a Mass Caregiver ('Allergy tested', 'Bamboo extract'). It is the ultimate 'Safe Choice' for dramatic results, proving that viral trends can be trustworthy staples."

      "title": "The Mass Empowerer",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in a hybrid of 'Green Lab' science—combining 'Bamboo extract' with the engineered 'Flex Tower brush.' It positions itself as a Democratizer, offering elite 'Sky High' impact at a mass-market access point. The value system is performance-led but safety-capped ('Ophthalmologist tested'), ensuring the dramatic results don't come at the cost of eye health."

    "identity": {
      "title": "Cosmic Trendsetter",
      "description": "The personality is a 'Trendsetter'—confident, energetic, and culturally plugged-in ('Eyes Go Cosmic'). The Magician archetype drives the promise of 'Limitless' transformation, supported by a Heroic focus on impact (#1 Rank). Visually, it uses 'Gen-Z Pop' codes—metallic pinks and deep space purples—to signal that this is a fun, modern tool, not a clinical prescription."

    "communication": {
      "title": "The Visual Promiser",
      "description": "Messaging hooks the user with the 'Result' (Length/Volume) rather than just ingredients. The USP is the 'Tech Engineer'—owning the 'Flex Tower' delivery system as the unfair advantage. It relies heavily on 'Viral Results' for proof, using aggressive Before/After macro photography to validate the 'Sky High' claim."
