      "title": "The Gentle Harmonizer",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the garden (Shea) rather than the lab, positioning itself as a Harmonizer that restores balance through nature. It operates on a Safety First value system, prioritizing 'hypoallergenic' comfort over aggressive actives. The strategy is pure Masstige—offering an aesthetic, 'shelfie-ready' product that remains a Democratic staple accessible to all."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Hype-Beast Lover",
      "description": "There is zero distance between brand and user; the tone is intimate, enthusiastic, and peer-to-peer ('Nuzzly', 'Obsessed'). Dominated by The Lover archetype (65%), it seduces through sensory language while The Jester (20%) adds a layer of fun. The visual identity creates a 'Gen-Z Pop' world where soft pastels meet chaotic energy, creating an immediate dopamine hit."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Romantic Alchemist",
      "description": "The messaging leads with the 'Hero Ingredient' (Shea) but persuades through Evocative poetry rather than data, selling the 'dream' of the scent. The Narrative is a Green Lab story—science optimizing a natural harvest. The focus is Lifestyle Aesthetic, using styled texture shots to trigger desire rather than educating on biological mechanisms."
