You are selling rationality on your website and viral relevance on Amazon, forcing the customer to reconcile two completely different buying motivations.",
    "evidence": "[SELF-EXPRESSION] WWW: 'The Pragmatist' (I buy it because it makes sense) vs. PDP: 'The Trend-Setter' (I buy it to show my taste)",
    "why_matters": "This fractures the product's identity. A customer seeking a smart, dermatologist-recommended value is alienated by hype. A customer chasing a viral trend is bored by pragmatism. By being both, you dilute the power of each message.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are telling two different stories about *why* someone should buy your lotion. Your website makes a logical case, while Amazon leverages your viral fame. You must decide: either lean into the 'Smart Choice' angle on Amazon by emphasizing price-per-ounce and dermatologist recommendations (Option A), or update the website to embrace your status as a 'Trend-Setter,' making it a hub for the culture you've created (Option B). A brand can't be both the sensible sedan and the viral sports car at the same time."

    "gap_description": "The WWW promises 'Restoration,' positioning the lotion as a 'Healer' for damaged skin. The PDP promises 'Hydration,' positioning it as a tool for daily 'Maintenance.' You are selling a cure on one channel and a vitamin on the other.",
    "evidence": "[FUNCTIONAL BENEFITS] WWW: 'Restoration (Healer 4/5)' vs. PDP: 'Hydration (Maintenance 3/5)'",
    "why_matters": "This creates a performance expectation gap. A user seeking to repair 'dry, sensitive skin' (WWW) has a different need than someone looking for 'lightweight, non-greasy' daily moisture (PDP). Failing to meet the 'healing' promise disappoints the first customer and creates negative reviews.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your product's core function is schizophrenic. The website promises recovery, a near-medical benefit, while Amazon promises simple daily upkeep. You must choose your fighter: either elevate the Amazon copy to match the 'Restoration' promise of the website, adding more evidence of skin barrier support (Option A), or downgrade the website's claims to simple 'Hydration' to align with the mass-market reality of your Amazon success (Option B). You can be a prescription or a vitamin, but trying to be both erodes the credibility of each."

    "evidence": "[PERSONALITY] WWW: 'The BFF' (Slang, equality) vs. PDP: 'The Insider' (Cool, knowing)",
    "why_matters": "While both are friendly, the WWW's extreme 'BFF' tone can feel juvenile to a broader audience, while the PDP's 'Insider' tone has wider appeal and more authority. The drift suggests an unconscious market correction is already happening on Amazon.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand has two friendly faces. The website is the high-energy BFF screaming with excitement, while Amazon is the cooler, more confident insider. The hard choice is deciding which friend scales better: do you rein in the website's effusive personality to match the slightly more mature, aspirational 'Insider' voice that works on Amazon (Option A), or do you inject the '#vanillagirlie' slang into the Amazon page to maintain absolute consistency with your DTC core (Option B)?

    "gap_description": "Your tone is highly consistent (90%), but the website's reliance on hyper-specific slang ('#vanillagirlie', 'Gourmand Girlies') is a high-wire act. The Amazon page wisely pulls back to a more broadly 'Conversational' and 'Excited' tone, reducing risk.",
    "evidence": "Formality Slider: WWW 5/5 ('Slang') vs. PDP 4/5 ('Conversational')",
    "why_matters": "Internet slang has a short half-life. What is cool today can feel dated and cringe-worthy tomorrow. The Amazon page's slightly more timeless enthusiasm is more durable and less likely to alienate new audiences or require constant updates.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand's voice is riding a trend wave that is guaranteed to crash. The website's specific slang is sharp now, but the Amazon page's broader enthusiasm is more evergreen. You face a critical decision: either commit fully to the ephemeral, updating your slang dictionary quarterly across all channels (Option A), or adopt the more stable, universally understood enthusiasm of the PDP as your global standard to future-proof your copy (Option B). Relevance is a rental, but personality can be an asset."

    "evidence": "Social Proof Scale: WWW (2,481 Reviews) vs. PDP (54,062 Reviews + #1 Rank)",
    "why_matters": "Your own website is your most muted advocate. Customers use the brand site to validate what they see on marketplaces. Hiding your most powerful proof points makes the brand look smaller and less authoritative than it actually is, creating doubt instead of confidence.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon page is a monument to your market dominance, while your website is a quiet boutique. This humility is costing you authority. The choice is stark: either continue treating your DTC site as a sandboxed aesthetic experience (Option A), or import the aggressive social proof—the '#1 Best Seller' badge, the 54,000 reviews—onto your homepage to reflect the powerhouse brand you have actually become (Option B). You've already won the war on Amazon; it's time to announce the victory on your home turf."
