    "description": "Dr.Melaxin executes a 'Viral Clinical' strategy, merging the sterile authority of a dermatological brand with the visceral 'gross-out' proof of TikTok trends. By using 'Real Dead Skin' visuals as the ultimate truth anchor, it democratizes professional-grade exfoliation for the mass market ($19.99/80ml). It is not a luxury experience; it is a high-volume mechanical fix for the skeptic who needs to see the debris to believe the clean."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Natural Harmonizer",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in Nature (Rice Extract) but directs it toward a specific Fixing mission (removing dead skin/blackheads). By framing aggressive exfoliation as 'Gentle Rice-Based,' it occupies The Harmonizer territory—promising to fix the problem without the harshness usually associated with chemical peels. The 'Value Hacker' positioning ($19.99 for a massive 80ml) makes this correction accessible to everyone."

      "title": "The Reliable Magician",
      "description": "The identity is a hybrid of The Reliable Expert (Dr. name, clinical percentages) and The Performer (Magician archetype showing 'Real Dead Skin' transformation). The Visual Identity is pure Pharma-Code—sterile, white, and red—signaling safety to offset the 'peeling' promise. The tone is Clinical Authority, using precise defensive language ('not product clumping') to validate the magic trick."

The narrative is The Lab Breakthrough, centering on a scientific formulation ('Peel Shot') rather than a founder's journey. The KSP strategy is Viral Results, leveraging the crowd ('100M+ Views') and visual shock ('Real Dead Skin') as the primary truth."

Emotionally, it delivers Intelligence (The Savvy Choice)—making the user feel smart for buying a viral, high-efficacy product at a value price. Socially, it is The Safe Choice, backed by massive review volume and 'No.1' badges that signal it is the default solution for the herd."
