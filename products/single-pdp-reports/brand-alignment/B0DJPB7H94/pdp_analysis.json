    "description": "Dr.Melaxin successfully merges the authority of the dermatology clinic with the velocity of TikTok. It democratizes professional-grade results ('Peel Shot') by using high-intensity social proof ('100M views', 'Cardi B') to validate a clinical mechanism.

Visually, it uses Pharma-Code aesthetics (charts, red targets) to ground the hype in science."

The USP is The Ingredient King, banking on 'Black Rice' as the hero. It relies on Viral Results for KSPs—trusting the crowd ('100M views') as much as the chart. The Focus is Science Education, teaching the user exactly how the peeling works."
