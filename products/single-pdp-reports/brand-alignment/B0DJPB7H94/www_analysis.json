    "headline": "The Clinical Pore Engineer",
    "description": "Dr.Melaxin positions itself as a 'vaccine-inspired' solutionist, bridging the gap between Korean innovation and clinical sterility. It feels like a high-performance mechanic for the face, prioritizing data ('85.9% pore bump reduction') and aggressive mechanisms ('Peel Shot') over sensory pampering. It plays the role of the Reliable Expert who diagnoses specific pathologies (pores, pigmentation) and prescribes a targeted, almost architectural, fix."

      "title": "The Data-Driven Healer",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in 'clinical trial data' and 'vaccine inspiration,' firmly establishing itself as a Healer focused on correcting pathologies like pigmentation and pore size. Its value system is Radical Transparency, sacrificing mystique to display percentage-based results. The positioning creates a 'Medical Authority' slot, offering approachable access to high-tech dermatological solutions."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Reliable Specialist",
      "description": "The personality is distant but highly competent, acting as a Reliable Expert who speaks in the language of 'prescriptions' and 'standards.'

    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "The Problem Solver",
      "description": "Messaging hooks the user with the 'End Benefit' (pore reduction) backed by Rational persuasion ('Clinical Results'). The USP is that of a Tech Engineer, owning the 'Peel Shot' delivery mechanism rather than just a raw ingredient. The narrative ignores the founder to focus on a 'Lab Breakthrough,' where science solves what nature cannot."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Corrective Intelligence",
      "description": "Functionally, the product is a Fixer, aiming for aggressive Correction of skin texture and clarity. This delivers an emotional payoff of Intelligence—the user feels 'savvy' for choosing a clinically validated tool. Socially, it creates a Knowledge Club, appealing to 'skintellectuals' who recognize ingredients like Tranexamic Acid and Spicules."
