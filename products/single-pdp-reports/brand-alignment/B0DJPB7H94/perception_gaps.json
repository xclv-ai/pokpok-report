The data demands a decision: either commit to the 'Sage' globally and strip the sensationalism from Amazon to preserve your medical dignity (Option A), or embrace the 'Magician' and rewrite the website to focus on the instant, visceral transformation of the peel (Option B). You cannot lecture the audience while performing magic tricks."

You face a binary choice: either enforce 'Derm-Validation' on Amazon to maintain your serious clinical positioning (Option A), or pivot the entire brand to 'Viral Results' and use the website to amplify the social hype loop (Option B).

    "why_matters": "This is a hidden risk because the 'Positioning' marker looks healthy. But if the voice contradicts the uniform, the uniform becomes a costume. Trust evaporates when the behavior doesn't match the dress code.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You have successfully dressed the brand in a white coat, but on Amazon, it is acting like a carnival barker. This creates a 'Costume Effect' where the authority feels fake. You must decide: discipline the Amazon voice to match the visual sterility (Option A), or admit the 'Doctor' is just a mascot and loosen the visual code to match the hype (Option B). A screaming doctor scares the patients."

You should choose: either update the website to feature the '178%' viral stats to maximize conversion (Option A), or restrict the Amazon claims to the conservative '85.9%' to protect scientific accuracy (Option B). Radical transparency is only radical if you show the biggest number."
