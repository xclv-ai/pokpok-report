    "description": "NIFEISHI operates as a pure 'High-Spec Utility' rather than a distinct brand. It mimics the codes of clinical dermatological authority (blue/yellow palette, molecule icons, 'Clinical Trial Effect' headers) but reveals its nature as a factory-direct commodity through inconsistent brand logos on packaging (ELAIMEI vs. NIFEISHI) and a reliance on raw percentage claims (60% Urea) over narrative. It plays the role of the aggressive fixer for the pragmatist who ignores branding in favor of numbers."

      "title": "The Chemical Fixer",
      "description": "The stance is purely Clinical (The Healer), deriving authority from high-percentage actives rather than nature or reputation.

      "title": "The Generic Specialist",
      "description": "The relationship is distant and transactional, acting as The Reliable Expert who delivers a diagnosis rather than a friendship. Dominated by The Hero archetype (60%), it frames skincare as a battle against 'thickened skin' and cracks. Visually, it adopts a Pharma-Code identity—sterile blues and high-vis yellows—to mimic established medical brands, while the voice remains flat and Descriptive."

    "communication": {
      "title": "The Spec Sheet",
      "description": "The hook is The Chemist, leading with '60% Urea' as the primary reason to believe. It attempts to be The Specialist by narrowing its scope to specific pathologies (cracked heels, calluses). The Focus is Science Education, using diagrams of skin layers and molecules to prove efficacy, validating itself through 'Clinical Trial' mimicry rather than social proof."

The emotional payoff is Relief/Safety—the absence of pain from cracks—rather than joy or status. It acts as The Pragmatist's tool: a logical purchase for a specific problem, devoid of lifestyle signaling."
