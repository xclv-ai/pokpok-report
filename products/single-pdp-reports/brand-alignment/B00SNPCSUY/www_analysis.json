    "description": "CeraVe acts as The Medical Authority, democratizing pharmaceutical-grade skincare through a 'Pharma-Code' visual identity that prioritizes legibility over luxury. It anchors its value in 'The Tech Engineer' territory (MVE Technology), positioning itself as a high-utility tool for biological restoration rather than a sensory treat. By stripping away mystique in favor of 'Safety First' transparency, it becomes the ultimate 'Safe Choice' for the pragmatist consumer."

The USP relies on being The Tech Engineer, owning the 'MVE Delivery Technology' as a proprietary engine of efficacy. The focus is Science Education, using diagrams and dermatologist quotes to prove 'how it works' rather than selling a lifestyle dream."
