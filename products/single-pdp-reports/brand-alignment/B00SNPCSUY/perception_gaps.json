    "evidence": "WWW: 'The Healer' (Restoration 2/5) vs. PDP: 'The Guardian' (Maintenance 3/5)",
    "why_matters": "Consumers looking for a 'Night Cream' usually want repair. If Amazon tells them it's just 'Maintenance,' they may downgrade to a cheaper lotion. Conflicting promise lowers value perception.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are caught between two medical philosophies: Interventional Correction (Fixing the problem) and Preventive Maintenance (Stopping the problem). This split dilutes the urgency of the purchase. You must decide: either pivot the Amazon listing to promise active 'Skin Renewal' to justify the night cream category (Option A), or downgrade the website claims to 'Daily Defense' and own the commodity staple market (Option B).

    "why_matters": "When a 'High Tech' product is sold primarily on 'Low Price,' the consumer begins to doubt the tech. It suggests the science is cheap, not advanced.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your website is trying to sell a piece of technology, but your Amazon page is selling a bargain. This 'Value Hacker' positioning on Amazon threatens to turn your proprietary science into a commodity. The choice is clear: either remove the aggressive low-price signaling on Amazon to protect the 'Tech Engineer' premium (Option A), or lean fully into the 'Democratization' story on the site and admit that the low price *is* the innovation (Option B). High-tech is rarely cheap; you have to pick one."

    "why_matters": "Relying on 'Free-from' claims (Safety) attracts a fearful, lower-loyalty customer. Relying on 'Logic' (Science) attracts a higher-value evangelist. Mixing them confuses the brand's power source.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your validation strategy is splitting. The website assumes the user wants to know *how* it works (Logic); Amazon assumes they just want to know it *won't hurt* (Safety). You must choose the primary trust anchor: either force the Amazon content to explain the biological mechanism of MVE to build authority (Option A), or simplify the website to focus on 'Clean/Safe' credentials to match the market's fear-based purchasing (Option B).

    "why_matters": "Raw data implies the product is a commodity part, like a screw. Rational explanation implies it is a formulated solution. The drift toward Raw Data risks commoditization.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon presence has become so clinical it borders on robotic. While safe, it lacks the 'Rational' connective tissue that explains *why* the data matters found on your site. You face a subtle choice: either strip the explanations from the site to create a purely utilitarian 'Data Bank' brand (Option A), or inject the 'Rational' storytelling back into Amazon to ensure the user understands the value of the ceramides, not just their existence (Option B). Data without narrative is just noise."

It offers the true 'Democratic' price ($15) and the true 'Majority' proof (54k reviews), while the site feels like a more expensive, emptier showroom. The bold move is to surrender to this reality: either lower the DTC price to match the Amazon reality and own the 'Mass Medical' position globally (Option A), or accept that the website is merely a brochure and direct all commerce to the channel where the democracy actually lives (Option B). You are a mass brand; stop pretending to be a boutique on your homepage."
