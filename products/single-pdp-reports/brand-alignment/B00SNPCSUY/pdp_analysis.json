    "description": "CeraVe is the beige Volvo of skincare: engineered for absolute safety, priced for the masses, and completely devoid of ego. It strips away the 'beauty' from the beauty industry, replacing mystique with molecules (Ceramides, Peptides, MVE). It doesn't promise to make you beautiful; it promises to make you intact."

Its mission is to Democratize clinical skin health, offering pharmaceutical-grade barrier repair (The Guardian) at a drugstore price point. The value system is ruthlessly Safety First, prioritizing 'non-irritating' tolerance over aggressive transformation."

Dominated by the Caregiver (60%) and Sage (30%) archetypes, it uses a Pharma-Code visual identity (diagrams, navy blue, sterile white) to signal medical authority. The tone is Clinical Authority: academic, dry, and zero-hype."

The Narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, citing 'Developed with Dermatologists' as the protagonist. It acts as The Value Hacker, leveraging patented MVE Technology to deliver high-end efficacy without the markup."
