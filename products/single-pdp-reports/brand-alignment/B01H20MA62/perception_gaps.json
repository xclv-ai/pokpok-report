    "gap_description": "The brand website promises to be a 'Guardian,' focused on protecting skin from future harm. The Amazon page shifts to being a 'Healer,' focused on repairing existing damage. This schizophrenia confuses the core motivation for purchase.",
    "evidence": "[Purpose] WWW: 'The Guardian (Maintenance)' vs. PDP: 'The Healer (Restoration)'",
    "why_matters": "This confuses the customer's motivation. Are they buying a daily shield or a recovery balm? The lack of a single, clear job-to-be-done weakens the value proposition and invites purchase hesitation.",
    "the_hard_choice": "The brand is straddling the line between a proactive vitamin and a reactive medicine. It must decide: Is Cetaphil a daily defensive habit, requiring a pivot on Amazon to emphasize protection (Option A)? Or has the market correctly identified it as a go-to for acute repair, meaning the website's 'maintenance' language is underselling its power (Option B)? You can't be both a bodyguard and a medic at the same time."

  "truth_2": {
    "truth_type": "gap",
    "headline": "The Guardian vs. The Seeker",
    "gap_description": "The website portrays a classic 'Guardian' archetype, a stable protector offering safety. Amazon, however, frames the same evidence to support 'The Seekers,' an identity based on empowering users with independent knowledge. One is a fortress, the other is a library.",
    "evidence": "[Archetypes Mix] WWW: 'The Guardian (Stability)' vs. PDP: 'The Seekers (Independence & Truth)'",
    "why_matters": "This is a subtle but deep identity crisis. Are you selling safety-in-a-jar (Guardian) or are you empowering consumers with knowledge to make their own choices (Seeker)? This affects how you frame 'dermatologist-backed'—is it a command or a piece of evidence?",
    "the_hard_choice": "The brand's soul is in conflict. Is your authority derived from being a paternalistic protector, or an empowering educator? You must choose: either lean into the 'Guardian' role and simplify messaging on Amazon to be more directive (Option A), or embrace the 'Seeker' and update the website to empower users with more data and education (Option B). A brand cannot be both a shield and a map."
  },
  "truth_3": {
    "truth_type": "gap",
    "headline": "Essential Staple vs. Bulk Commodity",
    "gap_description": "Both channels present a sterile, medical authority. However, the website positions the product as a 'Daily Essential,' a core part of a routine. Amazon's emphasis on 2-packs and low price pushes it towards 'Bulk Utility,' a commodity to be stockpiled.",
    "evidence": "[Positioning] Value Perception Slider: WWW 'Daily Essential (2/5)' vs. PDP 'Bulk Utility (1/5)'",
    "why_matters": "This small gap can erode pricing power over time. 'Essential' commands loyalty and a stable price. 'Utility' invites price comparisons and deal-seeking behavior. Amazon is training your customer to see you as a cheap commodity.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are viewed as a trusted staple on your own turf, but as a cheap commodity in the marketplace. The brand must decide: is the volume from multi-pack deals on Amazon worth the long-term erosion of your 'essential' status (Option A)? Or must you discipline Amazon's pricing and pack strategy to align with the higher 'daily essential' positioning of the main site (Option B)? A brand that lives by the discount will eventually die by it."

    "headline": "Emotion is Creeping In",
    "gap_description": "The brand's clinical voice is highly consistent, but the 'Enthusiasm' slider has drifted from 'Clinical (1/5)' on the website to 'Dry (2/5)' on Amazon. This is a subtle but significant shift from zero emotion to minimal emotion.",
    "evidence": "[Tone of Voice] Enthusiasm Slider: WWW 'Clinical (1/5)' vs. PDP 'Dry (2/5)'",
    "why_matters": "This drift, while tiny, suggests the Amazon copy team is trying to inject a sliver of marketing language ('instantly replenishes, intensely nourishes') into a brand built on its absence. It's the first crack in the dam of pure clinical authority. Unchecked, this leads to a less differentiated, more 'beauty'-like voice.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon voice is developing a faint pulse, while your core brand is defined by its flatline. You must make a choice: is this slight injection of energy a strategic test to improve conversion that should be adopted globally (Option B)? Or is it an undisciplined deviation that must be stamped out to protect the brand's powerful, sterile positioning (Option A)? Even a single drop of perfume can change the chemistry of a sterile lab."

    "truth_type": "untapped_strength",
    "headline": "Amazon Proves Your Mission",
    "gap_description": "Both channels perfectly align on the mission of being 'The Democratizers.' However, the Amazon PDP executes this mission with more powerful, tangible proof (price, reviews, sales rank) than the website's more abstract claim of global availability.",
    "evidence": "Amazon's proof points ('$19.48', '34,919 reviews', '#8 in Body Moisturizers') are a more potent execution of the 'Democratic' mission than the WWW's general claim ('in 70 countries').",
    "why_matters": "Your brand home is failing to tell its most powerful story. The Amazon page proves that your accessibility is your superpower, but the main website underplays this with vague corporate language.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your marketplace presence is a more compelling testament to your mission than your own website. The choice is this: do you let your website remain a sterile brochure while Amazon does the real work of proving your accessibility (Option A)? Or do you import Amazon's aggressive social proof and value-signaling onto your DTC site to fully own your identity as the undisputed, accessible choice for everyone (Option B)? A brand's story is only as strong as its best proof point."
