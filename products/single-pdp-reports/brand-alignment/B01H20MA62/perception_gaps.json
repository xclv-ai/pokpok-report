    "evidence": "[Functional Benefits] WWW: 'The Fixer (5/5)' vs. PDP: 'The Healer (4/5)'",
    "why_matters": "This drift, while minor, risks confusing the core promise. Is this product a medical intervention (WWW) or a soothing comfort product (PDP)? The lack of a single, sharp functional promise can weaken its authority against competitors who are more decisive.",
    "the_hard_choice": "The brand's promise is drifting from a hard clinical fix to a softer sensory relief. You must decide on the true functional core: Is this a product that *repairs* a biological barrier (Option A), requiring you to sharpen the PDP language back to the clinical 'Fixer' promise? Or has the market responded better to a promise of *healing* and sensory comfort (Option B), requiring you to update the website to reflect this softer, more emotional benefit? You cannot be both a surgeon and a nurse in the same sentence."

    "evidence": "[Messaging] Persuasion Logic: WWW 'Raw Data (1/5)' vs. PDP 'Rational (2/5)'",
    "why_matters": "This suggests the brand is adapting to a different customer mindset on Amazon, one that requires more hand-holding and logical explanation than the direct-to-brand audience. While consistent, it creates two slightly different conversational styles.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand's persuasion method is subtly forked. The question is which approach scales best: Do you believe your customer is a data-driven analyst who just wants the numbers (Option A), meaning you should strip the PDP down to pure, hard stats? Or do you believe the customer needs a logical narrative to be convinced (Option B), meaning the WWW is underperforming and needs to adopt Amazon's more explanatory style? A brand that can't decide how to make its case sounds like it's not sure of its own evidence."

    "evidence": "[Self-Expression] Purchase Motivation: WWW 'The Tool (1/5)' vs. PDP 'The Smart Choice (2/5)'",
    "why_matters": "This nuance flatters the Amazon shopper more than the DTC shopper. It suggests the Amazon customer wants to feel savvy for their purchase, while the DTC customer is assumed to be there for pure utility. This is a missed opportunity to elevate the user's identity on the brand's own property.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are telling two different stories about who your customer is. Is she someone who just buys a functional tool to solve a problem (Option A), requiring you to strip the PDP of its slightly more aspirational 'smart' language? Or is she a savvy, intelligent consumer who wants to be recognized for making a good decision (Option B), meaning your own website is failing to flatter her and needs to adopt the PDP's more empowering language?

    "why_matters": "Specialization is market power. By diluting the focus, even slightly, you open the door for competitors to claim they are *the* definitive solution for sensitive skin. This high-scoring but fragile alignment is a strategic risk.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your core competitive advantage is its laser-focus, but this focus is blurring on your most important sales channel. You face a critical decision: Is the future of the brand in owning the hyper-niche of 'sensitive skin' (Option A), which requires tightening the PDP focus immediately? Or is the volume opportunity in being a broader 'problem solver' (Option B), which means your website is too narrow and you must begin the strategic pivot to a wider positioning?

The choice is not about change, but about defense: Do you protect this asset at all costs, rejecting any marketing that introduces emotion to maintain this powerful clarity (Option A)? Or do you see this stable foundation as a launchpad to introduce more emotional products, risking the core identity for growth (Option B)? A fortress can protect you, but you can't grow anything new inside its walls."
