The data requires a choice: Option A: Rework the PDP to signal 'Daily Essential' by breaking up multi-packs and elevating the language to protect your price point. Option B: Accept you are a volume player, and lean into the 'Bulk Utility' positioning on your own site to maximize conversion. A brand cannot be both a trusted staple and a bargain-bin deal."

You must choose: Option A: Soften the WWW's 'Deity' stance to align with the more relatable 'Specialist' persona that is likely performing better in a competitive marketplace. Option B: Enforce absolute authority on the PDP, removing any hint of warmth to match the 'Robotic' WWW and maintain a consistent, god-tier expert persona.

The choice is clear: Option A: Lock down visual guidelines for the PDP, enforcing the rigid 'Swiss Grid' to ensure absolute consistency and brand control.
