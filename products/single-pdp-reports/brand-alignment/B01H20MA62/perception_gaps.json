    "gap_description": "On its own site, the brand is professionally 'Distant' (2/5). On Amazon, it becomes clinically 'Robotic' (1/5). This is a minor drift from a cool professional into a cold machine, intensifying its clinical feel at the expense of any latent warmth.",
    "evidence": "[Personality] WWW Emotional Heat: 'Distant (2/5)' vs. PDP Emotional Heat: 'Robotic (1/5)'",
    "why_matters": "The brand risks shifting from clinically competent to clinically cold. This micro-shift erodes any remaining warmth and could make the brand feel institutional and uncaring over time, especially in a competitive marketplace.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand's personality is getting colder on Amazon. The choice is stark: either inject a degree of professional warmth back into the Amazon copy to match the website's tone (Option A), or embrace the machine and update the global brand personality to be purely data-driven and algorithmic (Option B). Competence without a trace of warmth is the definition of a commodity."

    "gap_description": "The website signals absolute visual control with a rigid 'Swiss Grid' (1/5) layout. The PDP, constrained by Amazon's template, uses a more conventional 'Structured' (2/5) layout. The brand's strict discipline is slightly relaxed to fit the marketplace.",
    "evidence": "[Visual Identity] WWW Layout Control: 'Swiss Grid (1/5)' vs. PDP Layout Control: 'Structured (2/5)'",
    "why_matters": "While the commercial impact is minimal, this shows that the brand must compromise its visual identity to operate on other platforms. This is the first step toward brand drift, where channel needs begin to dictate brand execution.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You've built an identity on rigid control, but Amazon's platform forces a compromise. Option A: Accept the platform's looser container and find new ways to signal discipline within its walls. Option B: Invest heavily in custom A+ content that forces the rigid grid onto Amazon, potentially harming mobile usability. Discipline is a feature, until the container breaks it."

    "gap_description": "The website's narrative credits 'a pharmacist' for its origin, creating a 'Professional' hero (2/5). The Amazon page attributes the authority to faceless 'Dermatologists,' an institutional 'Nobel' hero (1/5). The human element is lost.",
    "evidence": "[Narrative] WWW Protagonist: 'The Professional (2/5)' vs. PDP Protagonist: 'The Nobel (1/5)'",
    "why_matters": "By removing the specific human creator, the brand story becomes more generic on Amazon. It loses a memorable detail and sounds more like every other competitor that also claims 'dermatologist recommended.'",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your origin story is schizophrenic: the website has a hero, but Amazon has a committee. You must decide: either re-insert the 'pharmacist' narrative into the Amazon A+ content to reclaim that sliver of humanity (Option A), or erase the pharmacist from the website and go all-in on the faceless, institutional power of 'The Board' (Option B). A story needs a character, not just a credential."

    "gap_description": "The brand's tone is already 'Serious' (2/5) on its website, which is core to its clinical authority. However, on Amazon, the tone becomes 'Grave' (1/5). This minor shift represents a drift towards extreme, and potentially alienating, solemnity.",
    "evidence": "[Tone of Voice] Humor Slider: WWW 2/5 (Serious) vs. PDP 1/5 (Grave)",
    "why_matters": "This drift toward zero-humor suggests a fear of the marketplace that could lead to overly sterile, ineffective copy. In an attempt to be safe, the brand risks becoming invisible and intimidating, losing connection with an audience that still desires a degree of humanity.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your brand voice is already disciplined, but on Amazon it's becoming rigid. The choice is whether to allow the marketplace team to operate with the 'Serious' but not 'Grave' tone of the core brand (Option A), or to update the global brand guide to reflect this new, extreme level of solemnity (Option B). The line between authoritative and intimidating is thin, and you are starting to cross it."

    "evidence": "[Positioning] The PDP's direct callout of the price and multi-pack configuration more aggressively communicates the 'Daily Essential' value proposition than the WWW.",
    "why_matters": "The brand's own website is under-leveraging its strongest value message. It's being too subtle and brand-precious, while the marketplace proves that a direct, value-oriented message is not only effective but core to the brand's identity.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon page is a better salesperson than your website because it's not afraid to talk about price and volume. The choice is clear: either bring the direct, value-centric messaging from Amazon onto your DTC site to boost conversion (Option A), or continue treating your own site like a high-end brochure while Amazon runs the business (Option B). You can't be shy about the very thing that makes people buy you."
