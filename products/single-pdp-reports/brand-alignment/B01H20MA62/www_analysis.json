    "headline": "The Gentle Medical Authority",
    "description": "Cetaphil feels like a doctor's prescription made accessible. It bypasses all aesthetic and emotional marketing to deliver a singular message of clinical reliability and safety for sensitive skin. It doesn't try to be cool, trendy, or luxurious; its entire identity is built on being the smartest, safest, and most pragmatic choice, earning trust through scientific validation, not aspirational storytelling."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "Clinical-Grade Democratizer",
      "description": "The brand operates as a Healer, anchoring its authority firmly in the clinical lab with a mission to fix skin barrier problems. This purpose is supported by a core value of Safety First, prioritizing gentle, hypoallergenic formulas over aggressive potency. It executes this through a Medical Authority positioning, stripping away aesthetics to deliver a utilitarian daily essential for the masses. The result for the user is access to dermatologist-backed care without the prescription."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Competent Caregiver",
      "description": "The brand maintains a professional distance, acting as a Reliable Expert. This is driven by a dominant Sage archetype (70%) that prioritizes data and a secondary Caregiver (20%) that promises protection. The visual identity is pure Pharma-Code—sterile, controlled, and designed to signal medical efficacy. Its Tone of Voice mirrors this, operating as a Clinical Authority that is serious, respectful, and matter-of-fact."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Evidence-Based Reassurance",
      "description": "The messaging is a clear Problem Solver, leading with the benefit ('48-hour hydration') and backing it with rational proof. Its USP is being The Specialist for sensitive skin, owning the '5 signs of skin sensitivity' diagnosis. The narrative is a classic Lab Breakthrough, born from a pharmacist's expertise and validated by 'rigorous clinical testing,' not a founder's personal journey. The page's focus is on Science Education, using its pixel real estate to prove claims, not inspire desire."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Safe, Pragmatic Restoration",
      "description": "The functional benefit is Restoration, promising to repair the skin's moisture barrier and relieve dryness. This delivers an emotional benefit of Relief and Safety—the peace of mind that comes from using a product that won't cause irritation. For the user, this signals a self-perception of being a Pragmatist who buys what works. Socially, it's The Safe Choice, connecting the user to a massive tribe that values dermatologist-approved reliability over fleeting trends."
