    "description": "Cetaphil feels like a doctor's prescription made accessible to everyone. It projects an overwhelming sense of safety, reliability, and clinical authority, completely stripping away aesthetic aspiration in favor of proven results. It plays the role of the family doctor: trusted, serious, a little sterile, but ultimately the one you turn to when you have a real problem that needs a guaranteed, gentle solution."

      "title": "Clinical Problem-Solver",
      "description": "Cetaphil positions itself as The Healer, deriving its authority purely from the Clinical Lab to fix skin problems. This purpose is supported by a core value of Safety First, prioritizing gentle tolerance over aggressive results. The strategy is that of a Medical Authority, delivering a utilitarian daily essential that functions like a prescription but is available to all. The result for the user is access to dermatologist-backed, clinical-grade care without the gatekeeping of a pharmacy."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Reliable Expert",
      "description": "There is a significant and intentional distance between the brand and user; it speaks as a Reliable Expert, not a peer. This is driven by The Sage archetype (70%), which prioritizes data and wisdom over emotion. This expert personality is perfectly reflected in its Pharma-Code visuals—sterile, controlled, and designed for trust, not trends. The voice is a Clinical Authority, using formal, serious language to deliver information, not build friendships."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Evidence-Based Treatment",
      "description": "Persuasion comes from being a Problem Solver, leading with the end benefit ('restores skin's moisture barrier') but backing it with hard, rational data. The USP is that of The Specialist, owning the niche of 'sensitive skin' treatment. Trust is anchored in its Narrative as a Lab Breakthrough, born from a pharmacist's expertise, not a founder's dream. The page's Focus is on Science Education, using its space to prove claims, not inspire desire."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Low-Risk Restoration",
      "description": "The functional promise is pure Restoration—repairing a damaged skin barrier and soothing irritation to restore biological health. This delivers an emotional benefit of Relief & Safety, calming the user's anxiety about flare-ups and reactions. For the user, this self-expresses a Pragmatist identity: 'I buy what's proven, not what's pretty.' Socially, it's The Safe Choice, connecting the user to a majority tribe that values dermatologist-backed reliability."
