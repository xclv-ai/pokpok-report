      "description": "The messaging is a direct Problem Solver, leading with the end benefit of barrier restoration, not the ingredients. This is supported by its USP as The Specialist for sensitive skin, an unfair advantage built on decades of trust. The narrative is a classic Lab Breakthrough, crediting a pharmacist's research, and all claims are validated by Derm-Validation and scientific proof, with a focus on deep Science Education."
