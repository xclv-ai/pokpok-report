    "description": "La Roche-Posay is the definitive 'Medical Authority' on the digital shelf. It completely rejects beauty codes—no sensory language, no lifestyle glamour—in favor of pharmaceutical rigor (Dermatologist Tested, Microbiome Science). It positions itself not as a cosmetic enhancement, but as a necessary health intervention for skin barrier repair, democratizing access to professional-grade safety for sensitive skin."

Its Ethos is Safety First, explicitly prioritizing 'Toleriane' (tolerance) and 'Safe Chemicals' over aggressive potency.

Visually, it executes a Pharma-Code strategy: sterile white, medical blue, and grid-based layouts that look like a prescription pad rather than a billboard."

      "description": "Messaging is strictly The Chemist, using ingredient names and 'Microbiome Science' as the hook. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, where '10 years of research' validates the product. It relies on Derm-Validation as its primary proof (The Board), focusing its content on Science Education (diagrams/charts) rather than inspiration."

      "title": "Restorative Relief",
      "description": "Functionally, it offers Restoration—physically repairing the barrier ('Double Repair') rather than just masking dryness. The emotional payoff is Relief / Safety, removing the anxiety of irritation for sensitive skin users. Socially, it functions as The Safe Choice, allowing the user to blend in with The Majority who trust the 'Holy Grail' of pharmacy skincare."
