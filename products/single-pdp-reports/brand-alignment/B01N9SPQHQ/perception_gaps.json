    "evidence": "[PURPOSE] WWW: 'Helps repair... maintain protective barrier' (Maintenance 3/5) vs. PDP: 'Restores skin's barrier in just 1 hour' (Correction 1/5)",
    "why_matters": "A customer seeking a daily moisturizer (WWW intent) may be scared off by the 'emergency repair' framing on Amazon. Conversely, a desperate customer on Amazon looking for a cure might view the WWW positioning as too passive.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are caught between being a 'Lifestyle Essential' and a 'Medical Intervention.' The data forces a choice: either soften the Amazon listing to 'Daily Protection' to capture the mass maintenance market (Option A), or sharpen the Website to 'Clinical Repair' to own the high-efficacy problem-solution space (Option B). You cannot be both a shield and a suture."

    "evidence": "[MESSAGING] WWW Hook: 'Double Repair' (Result 4/5) vs. PDP Hook: 'Ceramide-3 & Prebiotic Thermal Water' (Molecule 1/5)",
    "why_matters": "This disconnect confuses the conversion trigger. The website assumes the user wants simplicity, while Amazon assumes the user is a junior dermatologist. When they cross channels, the 'Simple' user gets overwhelmed by data, and the 'Smart' user feels patronized by marketing fluff.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are splitting your audience by intelligence. You must decide: either assume the customer is smart everywhere and lead with the 'Molecule' globally (Option A), or assume they just want the result and lead with 'Repair' globally (Option B). Intellectual vanity on one channel and marketing simplicity on the other creates a brand with two IQs."

    "why_matters": "The brand soul is conflicted. Is the magic in the *place* (French heritage) or the *process* (Clinical rigor)? Amazon users are buying a lab product; Website users are buying a French secret. This dilutes the core myth.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are trying to be a 'French Heritage Brand' on your site and a 'Clinical Lab Brand' on Amazon. The market is moving toward clinical transparency. You must choose: either aggressively romanticize the 'Source' on Amazon to differentiate from generic chemical brands (Option A), or purge the 'Town' narrative from the site to fully commit to the 'Lab' authority (Option B).

    "evidence": "[MISSION] WWW: 'Healthy-looking skin' (Optimization) vs. PDP: 'Skin Barrier Repair' (Correction)",
    "why_matters": "This 90% alignment score hides a dangerous trend. As the Direct-to-Consumer team chases 'Glow' and 'Beauty' keywords, they risk alienating the core patient base that relies on LRP for medical necessity. Optimization is a slippery slope away from Authority.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your website is flirting with 'Beauty' language while your product reality is 'Medicine.' You face a preventative choice: either discipline the website copy to banish 'healthy-looking' adjectives and stick to 'healthy' nouns (Option A), or pivot the Amazon strategy to 'Cosmeceutical' to chase the larger beauty audience (Option B).

    "evidence": "[FOCUS] PDP: Microbiome diagrams & repair cycle charts vs. WWW: Text-heavy explanations",
    "why_matters": "The Amazon listing proves that visual education drives conversion for this technical product. The website is under-leveraging the brand's best asset—its ability to teach—by relying on words instead of infographics.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon listing is a better teacher than your brand home. This is a missed opportunity for authority. You must choose: either invest in bringing the Amazon-grade 'Visual Syllabus' of diagrams to the website to close the engagement gap (Option A), or accept that the website is just a transaction portal and cede the educational authority to the marketplace (Option B). In complex skincare, the brand that teaches best, sells most."
