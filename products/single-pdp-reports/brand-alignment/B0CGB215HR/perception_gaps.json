    "evidence": "WWW: 'The Knowledge Club' (Intellect/Insider) vs. PDP: 'The Safe Choice' (Majority/Herd)",
    "why_matters": "Customers who buy for 'Intellect' feel cheapened by mass 'Safety' rhetoric. Customers buying for 'Safety' are intimidated by 'Intellect' jargon. You are splitting your audience psychographically.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are trying to be a secret weapon for the 'skintellectual' while simultaneously playing the volume game as a mass-market staple. This dilutes the cool factor of the former and the safety of the latter. You must choose: either market the 'Education' to build an army of smart evangelists (Option A), or lean into 'Social Proof' and become the mindless default choice for the masses (Option B). Intellect and safety are opposite psychological triggers."

    "the_hard_choice": "Your personality is in direct conflict. The website suggests medical authority, while the Amazon listing suggests emotional support. You must decide: either strip the emotion from Amazon to maintain the 'Clinical' pricing authority (Option A), or inject warmth into the website to build the 'Trusted Friend' bond (Option B). A doctor who acts like a cheerleader loses credibility, and a friend who acts like a doctor loses trust."

    "why_matters": "By framing 'Surveys' as the opposite of 'Real Science,' you inadvertently devalue your 7,000 Amazon reviews. You are telling your smartest customers to ignore your biggest asset.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are biting the hand that feeds you by disparaging 'surveys' on your site while banking on them on Amazon. You face a strategic ultimatum: either double down on the 'Lab' authority and treat the reviews as secondary noise (Option A), or embrace the 'Viral' reality and rewrite the website to celebrate the community consensus as the ultimate proof (Option B). You cannot claim superior science while relying on mob rule."

    "evidence": "Messaging Territory: 'The Problem Solver' (90% match) | Focus: Purely Functional",
    "why_matters": "Functional brands are replaceable. If a competitor offers 'ActivSmooth' for $29, you lose. You need emotional insulation to survive the commoditization of clinical skincare.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You have built a highly efficient machine for selling a 'Fix,' but you haven't built a brand that people love. Being a utility is dangerous because someone else can always do it cheaper. You must choose: continue to race to the bottom on price/performance (Option A), or sacrifice some functional density to build an emotional 'Lifestyle' layer that protects your margins (Option B). Efficiency wins the sale, but emotion wins the customer."

    "why_matters": "Visuals are the first price anchor. Your unwavering commitment to the 'Clinical Pop' look is the primary reason you can command a masstige price in a discount environment.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your visual discipline is your strongest asset, making a $39 product look like $100. The temptation will be to 'soften' it to get more clicks. You must decide: protect the 'Sterile' aesthetic at all costs to maintain price authority (Option A), or warm it up to increase click-through rates at the risk of looking 'Drugstore' (Option B). In this case, the sterile grid is the only thing separating you from the bargain bin."
