Option B: Humanize the Amazon page by injecting the 'Alex & Erin' story, betting that emotional connection can outperform sterile data in a crowded marketplace.

You are either a brand that earns the sale or a store that asks for it; trying to be both just confuses the customer."

Option B: Embrace the trend-driven identity and invest heavily in advertising to maintain the bestseller rank at all costs, accepting the high risk of being a momentum brand.
