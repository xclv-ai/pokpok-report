    "description": "goPure positions itself as the specialized solution for a singular, highly visible pain point: the 'turkey neck.' By combining clinical validation ('94% saw lifting') with massive social proof (#2 Best Seller, 7,800+ reviews), it democratizes med-spa results for the Amazon shopper. It strikes a 'Clinical Masstige' balance—expensive enough ($39.99) to be credible, yet accessible enough to be a daily staple."
