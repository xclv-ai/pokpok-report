    "description": "SimplyVital executes a ruthless 'Masstige' strategy, wrapping a commodity price ($19.99) in the visual codes of a high-end medical clinic. It dominates by acting as 'The Safe Choice'—leveraging massive social proof (#1 Bestseller) and 'Made in USA' nationalism to de-risk the purchase of active ingredients like Retinol. It is not a brand you fall in love with; it is a tool you trust to do the job."

      "description": "Messaging is stripped of poetry, focusing on The Chemist's approach of listing ingredients as the hook. The USP is that of The Value Hacker—offering a '3% Retinol' complex at a drugstore price. It relies on Viral Results (1 million+ customers) as its primary proof, using the crowd to validate the science."

      "title": "Corrective Social Safety",
