    "evidence": "WWW: 'Our small team decided to create' vs. PDP: 'Science-Proven Formula'",
    "why_matters": "The website builds connection through human empathy, but the marketplace builds authority through institutional coldness. When a user navigates from Amazon to the site, they lose the 'Scientific Authority' that attracted them in the first place.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are trying to humanize a brand that sells on dehumanized efficiency. The friction is palpable. You must choose: either elevate the Founder story to Amazon to give the science a face (Option A), or kill the Founder story on the site and let the 'Science-Proven Formula' stand alone as the hero (Option B).

    "evidence": "WWW: 'Effective yet gentle' vs. PDP: 'Advanced Retinoid Complex 3%'",
    "why_matters": "This is a dangerous expectation gap. A customer buying 'Gentle' who receives '3% Retinoid' may feel betrayed by irritation. A customer buying 'Power' who sees 'Gentle' on the site may doubt the efficacy.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are marketing 'Baby Lotion' safety on one channel and 'Prescription Strength' results on the other. This risks both returns and reputation. You must decide: either downgrade the potency claims on Amazon to ensure the 'Gentle' promise is kept (Option A), or update the website to warn users that this is 'Serious Skincare' not 'Gentle Care' (Option B).

    "why_matters": "The 'Ruler' energy on Amazon is converting well, but it contradicts the humble 'Everyman' invitation on your site. If the Amazon tone becomes too imperious, you lose the 'Democratizer' charm that makes you unique.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon success is pushing you toward arrogance, while your website remains humble. You face a choice: either temper the 'Market Dominance' signaling on Amazon to stay relatable (Option A), or embrace 'The Ruler' globally and position yourself as the undeniable King of the Category (Option B). Humility is nice, but dominance is profitable."

    "why_matters": "Your greatest asset isn't your formula or your founder; it's your massive user base. PDP proves that 'Social Proof' is a stronger hook than 'Science' or 'Story.'",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are treating your 1 million customers as a 'Trust Badge' when they should be the 'Main Character.' The data suggests a pivot: either keep the current balance (Option A), or aggressively restructure the entire brand identity around 'The People's Choice,' making the '1 Million' figure the headline of the entire company (Option B). In a commodity market, popularity is the highest form of quality."
