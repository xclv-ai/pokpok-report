    "headline": "The Clinical Problem-Solver",
    "description": "Aquaphor feels less like a skincare brand and more like a medical device you keep in your first-aid kit. It completely bypasses sensory pleasure and lifestyle aesthetics to position itself as a ruthlessly effective, doctor-approved tool for fixing damaged skin. It plays the role of the on-call dermatologist: reliable, authoritative, and focused exclusively on healing."

      "description": "The brand's purpose is to be The Healer, anchoring its authority in the clinic, not the garden, to restore damaged skin. This mission is pursued via a Safety First value system, guaranteeing hypoallergenic tolerance over aggressive potency. Its positioning as a Medical Authority is made accessible through a democratic price point, making clinical-grade care a household staple."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Sterile Expert",
      "description": "The psychological distance between brand and user is vast; it behaves as The Reliable Expert, not a friend. Dominated by the Caregiver archetype (70%), it projects stability and protection. This identity is reinforced by a sterile, Pharma-Code visual system and a Clinical Authority tone of voice that is factual, serious, and devoid of any emotional warmth."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Clinical Problem-Solving",
      "description": "The messaging is that of a Problem Solver, using rational arguments to prove efficacy. Its USP is as The Specialist for damaged skin, leveraging a Lab Breakthrough narrative to build trust in its formula. All communication focuses on Science Education, using icon-based explainers to prove its claims rather than lifestyle imagery to inspire desire."
