    "headline": "The Clinical Pragmatist",
    "description": "Aquaphor acts as the ultimate utilitarian problem-solver in the skincare arsenal. It strips away all emotion, narrative, and aesthetic fluff to focus entirely on the mechanical repair of broken skin barriers.

      "title": "The Medical Authority",
      "description": "The brand anchors itself firmly in the clinic, deriving authority from 'Dermatologist Recommendations' rather than nature.

      "title": "The Stoic Caregiver",

Dominated by The Caregiver (60%) archetype, it expresses protection through a sterile Pharma-Code visual identity. The voice is The Clinical Authority: dry, serious, and matter-of-fact, focusing solely on the mechanics of healing."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Functional Solutionist",
      "description": "The messaging leads with the Result ('Relief'), persuading through Rational logic and clinical proof. The USP is The Specialist—owning the 'Healing' of specific skin pathologies like chapping and cracking. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough story, where education about the 'semi-occlusive' formula builds trust."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Safety",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Healer, offering aggressive restoration to damaged skin barriers. The emotional payoff is Relief—the cessation of pain and the return to normalcy (Safety).
