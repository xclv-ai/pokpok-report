    "headline": "The Gentle Guardian",
    "description": "Aveeno occupies the role of the ultimate safety net in the skincare aisle. By marrying the clinical authority of '300+ Clinical Studies' with the gentle, ancestral wisdom of 'Prebiotic Oat,' it positions itself as the sensible, low-risk choice for the entire family. It doesn't promise a miracle transformation; it promises the restoration of normalcy and the quiet confidence of skin that just works."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Trusted Harmonizer",
      "description": "The brand balances two distinct authorities: the garden (Oat) and the lab (Dermatologist Recommended), creating a 'Harmonizer' purpose that seeks to restore natural balance. Values are anchored in 'Safety First,' prioritizing tolerance and gentleness above aggression or trendiness. The strategy is pure Masstige—offering clinical-grade efficacy at a democratic price point that anyone can access."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Nurturing Scientist",
      "description": "The psychological distance is close but respectful—like a knowledgeable nurse or family doctor. Dominated by The Caregiver (60%) archetype, the brand projects protection and service above all else. Visually, it uses an 'Earthy Organic' code (beige, soft greens) to soften the clinical data, while the tone remains a 'Gentle Guide,' helpful and encouraging without shouting."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Functional Problem Solver",
      "description": "The messaging is a masterclass in 'The Problem Solver' territory, identifying a specific pain (Dry Skin) and offering a tangible fix (Nourish/Protect). The USP is 'The Ingredient King,' owning the mental link to 'Oat' as a proprietary hero. The narrative is a 'Green Lab' story, proving that nature's ingredients are best unlocked through rigorous scientific study."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Comfort",
      "description": "Functionally, the product is a 'Restorer,' fixing the broken moisture barrier rather than just masking it. The emotional payoff is 'Relief' and 'Comfort'—the removal of the anxiety that comes with itchy, tight skin. Socially, it represents 'The Safe Choice,' a badge of pragmatic parenting and sensible self-care that signals belonging to the rational majority."
