    "headline": "The Clinical Pragmatist",
    "description": "Aquaphor occupies the ultimate utilitarian slot in the market: the trusted medical fixer. It completely bypasses aesthetic aspiration to sell pure biological restoration and safety. It feels like a prescription you don't need a doctor to buy—sterile, serious, and undeniably effective for when things go wrong."

      "title": "The Medical Authority",
      "description": "The brand's foundation is built on the authority of the 'Dermatologist' and the clinical lab. Its purpose is strictly pathological—fixing broken skin barriers—rather than cosmetic enhancement. It positions itself as a Daily Essential in the Medicine Cabinet, offering professional-grade healing at a democratic price point."

      "title": "The Reliable Caregiver",
      "description": "Aquaphor projects the persona of a no-nonsense medical professional. Dominated by The Caregiver (70%) archetype, it offers stability and protection without emotional fluff.

    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Functional Problem Solving",
      "description": "The messaging is ruthlessly efficient, hooking the user with a specific problem ('Chapped,' 'Dry') and offering a mechanical solution. The Narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, relying on the 'Clinically Proven' stamp as its origin myth. It focuses entirely on Education and Proof, ignoring lifestyle inspiration."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Safety",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Restorer, physically repairing the skin barrier through occlusion. Emotionally, it provides Relief and Safety—the absence of pain or worry.
