    "gap_description": "Your Strategy defines the visual world as 'Earthy Organic'—a balance of clinical precision and the warmth of oatmeal beige (Thermostat 3/5). On Amazon, the execution freezes into 'Pharma-Code' (Thermostat 2/5). You have stripped away the 'Nature' half of your 'Science + Nature' equation, leaving a sterile, white hospital aesthetic that feels cold and generic.",

    "why_matters": "When you lose the visual warmth, you lose the emotional differentiator that separates Aveeno from Cetaphil or CeraVe. You become just another white bottle in a sea of clinical sameness, eroding the premium 'wellness' perception that justifies brand loyalty.",

    "why_matters": "Positioning a daily lotion as a heavy-duty repair tool narrows your addressable market.
