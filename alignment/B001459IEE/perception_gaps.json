    "why_matters": "The visual disconnect breaks the dopamine loop. The user buys into the 'Warm Organic' dream on the site but receives a cold, sterile bottle reality on Amazon. It lowers the perceived value from 'Lifestyle' to 'Utility.'",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are selling a warm oat bath on the site and a cold plastic bottle on the shelf. The eye detects the lie instantly. You must decide: either sterilize the website to match the honest clinical reality of the packaging (Option A), or invest in rich, textured A+ Content on Amazon to force the 'Organic' warmth onto the cold marketplace grid (Option B).

    "why_matters": "The 'Family Staple' has low authority but high affection. The 'Medical Authority' has high authority but low affection. Switching between them creates a brand that feels manipulative—using science when convenient and family vibes when not.",

    "why_matters": "The 'Harvest' story is emotionally potent—it connects to nature and origin. The 'Green Lab' is a compromise. The Amazon page is leaving money on the table by not fully deploying the 'Harvest' imagery and narrative found on the site.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your website proves that the 'Oat Field' is a powerful visual hook, yet your Amazon page retreats into a generic 'Lab' setting. You have an opportunity: either abandon the field to focus purely on clinical efficacy (Option A), or aggressively port the 'Harvest' narrative to Amazon to differentiate from the sea of white clinical bottles (Option B). In a digital aisle of plastic, a field of grain is a disruption."
