    "gap_description": "Your Strategy sells 'Protection' (preventing issues), but your PDP sells 'Restoration' (fixing damage). The website positions the lotion as a daily shield (Buffer 2/5), while Amazon frames it as emergency medicine for 'distressed' skin (Healer 4/5). You are confusing the customer about when to use the product—before the problem starts, or after it hurts?",
    "evidence": "[FUNCTIONAL BENEFITS] Strategy: 'Protection (Immunity)' vs. Reality: 'Restoration (Recovery)'",
    "why_matters": "A 'Protection' product is a daily habit (high LTV). A 'Restoration' product is a one-time fix (low frequency). By framing this as a repair tool on Amazon, you risk training customers to only buy it when their skin is cracking, rather than every day.",

    "evidence": "[MESSAGING] Strategy: 'The Problem Solver' vs. Reality: 'The Chemist'",
    "why_matters": "Intellectual arguments ('The Chemist') work for high-involvement purchases, but for a commodity body lotion, they create friction. Customers want to know 'Will this stop the itch?' not 'How does the oat lipid layer function?'",
