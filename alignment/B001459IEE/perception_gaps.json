You are trying to be a sterile surgeon, but on the shelf, you are acting like a nurturing parent. This warmth kills the clinical distance required for high-authority pricing.",
    "evidence": "[PERSONALITY] Strategy: 'Distant (2/5)' vs. Reality: 'Affectionate (4/5)'",
    "why_matters": "Clinical authority requires a degree of coldness/distance. By being too warm ('Affectionate'), you reframe the product from a 'Medical Intervention' (High Value) to a 'Daily Comfort' (Commodity). You are trading authority for likability.",

    "evidence": "[VISUAL IDENTITY] Strategy: 'Pharma-Code (Sterile)' vs. Reality: 'Earthy Organic (Harmony)'",
    "why_matters": "Visuals process faster than text. Even if you say 'Clinical,' the beige/green color palette screams 'Gentle Nature.'

    "evidence": "[NARRATIVE] Strategy: 'The Nobel (Pure Science)' vs. Reality: 'Studio/Hybrid (Nature + Science)'",
    "why_matters": "When a 'Clinical' brand leans too heavily on ingredients (Oats, Avocado), it loses the 'Scientific Breakthrough' mystique.
