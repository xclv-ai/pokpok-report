Why does your Amazon page look like a botanical garden? You are trading distinct medical authority for generic 'natural' category cues.",
    "evidence": "[VISUAL IDENTITY] Strategy: 'Pharma-Code (Sterile 1/5)' vs. Reality: 'Earthy Organic (Radiating 4/5)'",
    "why_matters": "When a clinical brand adopts 'warm and earthy' visuals, it loses the visual cue for 'potency.' The customer buys Aquaphor because it looks like medicine. If it looks like oatmeal lotion, the perceived efficacy drops, and you invite price comparison with lower-tier grocery brands.",
    "do_this_now": "Purge the 'Earthy' tones immediately. Return to Stark White backgrounds and Medical Blue typography in your A+ Content. Replace 'lifestyle' lighting with high-contrast, clinical lighting that emphasizes the molecular barrier, not the 'goodness of nature.'"

    "headline": "The Cure vs. The Balance",
    "gap_description": "Your Strategy defines the Purpose as 'The Healer' (treating pathology), but the PDP communicates 'The Harmonizer' (natural balance). Aquaphor exists to fix broken things; Aveeno exists to maintain healthy things. By softening your mission on Amazon, you are solving a lower-value problem.",
    "evidence": "[PURPOSE] Strategy: 'The Healer (Clinical Correction)' vs. Reality: 'The Harmonizer (Natural Balance)'",
    "why_matters": "The 'Healer' commands a premium because the need is urgent (bleeding, cracking, pain). The 'Harmonizer' is a maintenance purchase. By shifting the PDP to softer language, you de-escalate the urgency of the purchase, lowering conversion rates among high-intent sufferers.",
    "do_this_now": "Rewrite the About This Item bullets to focus on 'Repair' and 'Pathology' rather than 'Nourishment.' Use words like 'Fix,' 'Seal,' and 'Protect' instead of 'Soothe' and 'Balance.' Reclaim the medical emergency use-case."

    "evidence": "[NARRATIVE] Strategy: 'The Lab Breakthrough (Sterile 1/5)' vs. Reality: 'The Green Lab (Harvest 4/5)'",
    "why_matters": "Narrative dissonance confuses the user's mental sorting. If they want 'Nature,' they buy Aveeno. If they want 'Science,' they buy Aquaphor. By trying to be both on Amazon, you become neither, losing the purists on both sides.",
    "do_this_now": "Remove the 'Goodness of Nature' messaging from the PDP. Replace the 'Oat Stalk' imagery with 'Molecular Structures' or 'Skin Barrier Cross-Sections.' The hero of your story is the Chemical Formula, not the harvest."

    "why_matters": "Doctors aren't 'pleasant'; they are effective. As your tone warms up to match the 'Earthy' visuals, you erode the power dynamic. A 'pleasant' brand is a commodity; a 'distant' brand is an authority. Don't let the agency make you 'approachable.'",
