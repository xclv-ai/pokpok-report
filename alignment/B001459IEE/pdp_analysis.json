By validating natural ingredients (Prebiotic Oat) with rigorous clinical data (Dermatologist Recommended), it removes the risk from 'natural' skincare.

The narrative is The Green Lab, where nature is optimized by science. The focus is on Science Education, using 'Clinical Studies' and 'Dermatologist Recommendations' to build trust rather than relying on lifestyle inspiration."
