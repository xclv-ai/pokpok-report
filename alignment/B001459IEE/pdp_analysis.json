    "description": "Aveeno occupies the trusted middle ground between the sterile pharmacy and the wild garden. It doesn't sell 'beauty' or 'luxury'; it sells 'health' and 'normality' to the massive 'sensitive skin' majority. By anchoring its science in a humble ingredient (Oat), it makes clinical efficacy feel gentle, safe, and democratic."
