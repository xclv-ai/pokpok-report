    "description": "Aveeno occupies the trusted middle ground between the pharmacy and the garden. By validating the humble oat with clinical rigor ('Prebiotic', 'Dermatologist Recommended'), it removes the risk from natural skincare, positioning itself as the safe, logical choice for the entire family. It feels like a gentle prescription from a doctor who prefers home remedies over harsh chemicals."

      "title": "The Gentle Harmonizer",
      "description": "The brand derives authority from a synthesis of nature and science ('Prebiotic Oat' + 'Dermatologist Recommended'), acting as a Harmonizer that restores biological balance. Its value system is Safety First, sacrificing aggressive potency for absolute tolerance on sensitive skin. Strategically, it is The Gentle Giant—a reliable, mass-market staple that offers medical-grade trust at a commodity price."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Scientific Caregiver",
      "description": "The psychological distance is that of a wise, nurturing guide—close enough to care, but expert enough to cure. Dominated by The Caregiver archetype (60%), it projects warmth and protection through an Earthy Organic visual code (oatmeal beige and medicinal green). The tone is a Gentle Guide, speaking with professional restraint and comforting assurance."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Validated Comfort",
      "description": "The messaging acts as a Problem Solver, hooking the user with functional relief ('Heals dry skin') validated by a Dermatologist Authority. The narrative is a Green Lab story, where the 'goodness of nature' is unlocked by the 'power of science.' The focus is on Trust/Proof, using clinical claims to silence skepticism."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Pragmatism",
      "description": "Functionally, it offers Restoration, fixing the skin's barrier rather than just masking dryness. Emotionally, it provides Relief and Safety, removing the anxiety of irritation. Socially, it is The Safe Choice—a Pragmatist's badge that signals rationality and immunity to marketing hype."
