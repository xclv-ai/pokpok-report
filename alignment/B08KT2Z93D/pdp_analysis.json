      "description": "The messaging ignores cold data to focus on Evocative persuasion, selling the 'Dream' of the scent. The USP is the Ingredient King—owning the mental link to 'Shea.' The narrative is a Green Lab story, optimizing a natural harvest to create a Lifestyle Aesthetic that prioritizes desire over education."
