    "description": "eos occupies the rare 'Viral Masstige' space, successfully transforming a commodity body lotion into a high-dopamine lifestyle accessory. By wrapping a utilitarian moisturizer (Maintenance) in Gen-Z Pop visuals and a Hype Beast voice ('Nuzzly', 'Obsessed'), it democratizes the luxury of 'Self-Care' for the mass market. It feels like a recommendation from a cool, trusted friend rather than a prescription from a dermatologist."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Sensory Alchemist",

The USP is The Ingredient King, staking a claim on 'Shea' as the owned mental asset. The focus is entirely Lifestyle Aesthetic, using editorial imagery to trigger desire rather than education."
