    "gap_description": "Your Brand Strategy includes a tertiary archetype of 'The Innocent' (15% - Clean/Pure), but the Amazon PDP swaps this for 'The Caregiver' (15% - Soothe/Protect).

    "do_this_now": "Establish a 'Slang Expiration' review. Any slang term used on the PDP ('Vanilla Girl Era') must be audited quarterly to ensure it hasn't become cringe. If in doubt, revert to 'Cheeky' (3/5) rather than 'Slang' (5/5)."
