    "evidence": "[SELF-EXPRESSION] Strategy: 'Smart Choice (2/5)' vs. Reality: 'The Statement (4/5)'",
    "why_matters": "This is a positive gap, but a dangerous one to ignore. If you continue marketing it merely as 'smart' (cheap/effective), you undercut the 'cool' equity the public has gifted you. You are leaving pricing power and brand heat on the table.",

    "gap_description": "Your Personality strategy is to be the 'BFF' (1/5 Authority)—pure peer equality. On Amazon, you've drifted slightly to 'The Insider' (2/5 Authority) by using language like 'Pro tip: Layer this.' You are starting to teach rather than just share.",
    "evidence": "[PERSONALITY] Strategy: 'The BFF (1/5)' vs. Reality: 'The Insider (2/5)'",

    "evidence": "[KEY SELLING POINTS] Strategy: 'The Users (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'The Fans (5/5)'",
    "why_matters": "You are marketing with standard confidence while sitting on a nuclear reactor of social proof. The discrepancy means your creative is too modest. You are whispering 'we are popular' while the shelf is screaming 'we are a phenomenon.'",

    "evidence": "[ARCHETYPES MIX] Alignment: 100% | Opportunity: Push Lover from 65% to 75%",
    "why_matters": "You have already proved the market accepts 'nuzzly' and 'sensual' from a $9 brand. By pushing harder—more skin texture in visuals, more tactile language ('glides', 'melts', 'caress')—you can make 'clinical' brands feel cold and sterile by comparison.",
