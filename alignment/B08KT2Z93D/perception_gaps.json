You must choose the relationship dynamic: either commit to the 'Trendsetter' persona globally and risk alienating the tired mom on Amazon (Option A), or soften the website to 'Trusted Friend' and lose the Gen-Z viral edge (Option B).

The choice is strategic: either strip the descriptive adjectives from Amazon to force a pure 'Vibe' sale (Option A), or inject more descriptive grounding into the website to help the uninitiated understand the scent (Option B).

You face a choice of endurance: either update the website copy every 3 months to chase the new slang (Option A), or discipline the brand voice to a 'Timeless Conversational' style that survives the trend cycle (Option B).

The data suggests an opportunity: either tone down the Amazon sensuality to match the website's 'fun' vibe (Option A), or unleash the 'Lover' archetype fully on the website to drive higher emotional conversion (Option B).
