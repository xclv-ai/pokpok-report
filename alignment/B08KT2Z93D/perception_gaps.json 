The vibe is less about 'skin health' and more about a 'daily treat' that happens to moisturize, positioning the product as a low-risk, high-reward purchase that bridges the gap between a drugstore commodity and a Sephora splurge.",

      "gap_description": "Your Strategy defines the purchase as an act of 'Trend-Setting' (Relevance), but on Amazon, the low price point and massive ubiquity reframe it as 'Pragmatism' (Rationality). You are trading cultural currency for volume. While you are undeniably popular, you are dangerously close to losing the 'cool factor' that separates a viral hit from a commodity staple.",
      "evidence": "[SELF-EXPRESSION] Strategy: 'The Trend-Setter (Relevance)' vs. Reality: 'The Pragmatist (Rationality)'",
      "why_matters": "When a brand shifts from 'Trending' to 'Pragmatic,' it loses pricing power and emotional stickiness. You become replaceable by the next cheap option rather than being the desired object.",

      "gap_description": "Your visual identity relies on 'Entropy' and movement—swirls and floating ingredients—to convey the 'Whipped' texture. On Amazon, the strict grid layout dampens this, making the brand look more static (3/5) than the fluid, dynamic identity (4/5) envisioned. You are selling texture, but showing boxes.",
      "evidence": "[VISUAL IDENTITY] Strategy: 'Playful Entropy (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Dynamic Grid (3/5)'",
      "why_matters": "Static images fail to convey 'Whipped' or 'Cashmere.' If the customer cannot visually 'feel' the texture, the sensory claim loses potency, reducing the product to just another lotion bottle.",
