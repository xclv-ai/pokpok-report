    "score_summary": "The brand achieves a STABLE score of 74/100. While the visual identity and tonal energy are perfectly synchronized ('Gen-Z Pop'), the strategic positioning collapses on Amazon, drifting from 'Trendy Status' to 'Grocery Staple' due to an over-reliance on safety claims and aggressive value signaling.",

    "narrative": "On Amazon, eos feels like the 'Internet's Best Friend'—a high-energy, low-risk impulse buy. It successfully sheds the clinical sterility of the category, presenting as a 'Treat' rather than a 'Treatment.' However, the heavy emphasis on the low price point ($9.98) and safety claims ('Dermatologist-tested') slightly undercuts the 'Cashmere' aspiration, making it feel more like a smart grocery run than a curated beauty ritual.",

      "gap_description": "Your Target Strategy is 'The Clean Essentialist' (Trendy Status), aiming to be the cool girl's bathroom accessory. However, your PDP execution falls into 'The Gentle Giant' (Family Staple) territory by prioritizing safety seals and mass appeal awards. You are diluting your exclusivity to comfort the lowest-common-denominator shopper.",
      "evidence": "[POSITIONING] Strategy: 'The Clean Essentialist (Trendy Status)' vs. Reality: 'The Gentle Giant (Family Staple)'",
      "why_matters": "When you position as a 'Staple' rather than a 'Status Item,' you lose pricing power and brand loyalty. You become replaceable by the next generic brand that offers 24-hour moisture for $1 less.",
      "do_this_now": "Remove the 'Allure' seal from the primary hero image stack and replace it with a lifestyle shot that implies social status or 'aesthetic' routine. Relegate the safety awards to the A+ content."

      "headline": "Boring Them with Safety",
      "gap_description": "The website values are 'Story-Led'—seducing the user with the narrative of 'Whipped Vanilla & Soft Musk.' The PDP, however, shifts to 'Safety First,' heavily emphasizing 'Hypoallergenic' and 'Paraben-Free' in the prime real estate. You are answering questions the customer hasn't asked yet, instead of triggering the desire they came for.",
      "evidence": "[VALUES] Strategy: 'The Trusted Tradition (Story-Led)' vs. Reality: 'Safety First (The Safe Harbor)'",
      "why_matters": "In the 'Masstige' category, desire drives conversion, not safety. By leading with what isn't in the bottle (parabens), you stop the customer from dreaming about what is in the bottle (cashmere musk).",
      "do_this_now": "Rewrite the second and third bullets. Push all 'free-from' and clinical claims to the final bullet. Dedicate the top bullets exclusively to the 'Scent Journey' and the emotional pay-off of the application ritual."

      "headline": "The Authority Trap",
      "gap_description": "Your Target Strategy relies on being 'The Viral Favorite'—trust built through peer validation and social hype. Your PDP reverts to 'The Institutional Standard,' leaning on dermatologists and magazine awards. You are ignoring your most potent asset (cultural relevance) to play by the rules of the old guard.",
      "evidence": "[TRUST MARKERS] Strategy: 'The Viral Favorite' vs. Reality: 'The Institutional Standard'",
      "why_matters": "Gen-Z buys what their feed tells them to buy, not what a doctor recommends. By acting like a clinical brand, you risk looking like 'Mom's lotion' rather than the 'Internet's Lotion.'",
      "do_this_now": "Inject social proof into the image carousel. Use a graphic overlay that says 'The Internet's Favorite' or quote a viral sentiment rather than just the clinical test results."

      "headline": "Price Point vs. Brand Equity",
      "gap_description": "While 'Masstige' is the goal, the PDP leans too hard into the 'Value' side of the equation. The prominent display of the $9.98 price tag alongside 'Grocery' cues creates a 'Daily Essential' vibe that conflicts with the 'Editorial' aesthetic of the packaging.",
      "evidence": "[POSITIONING] Strategy: 'Affordable Luxury' vs. Reality: 'Commodity Bargain'",
      "why_matters": "If the customer perceives you as a 'Bargain,' they will churn as soon as prices rise. You must frame the price as a 'Steal' (getting more than you paid for), not just 'Cheap.'",
      "do_this_now": "Adjust the copy to focus on the 'Layering Experience.' Frame the lotion as a perfume-enhancer. This elevates the perceived value of the $9.98 spend from a utility purchase to a beauty hack."

      "gap_description": "The Target Tone is 'Hype Beast'—enthusiastic and dreamy ('So creamy, So dreamy'). The PDP execution drifts into 'Punny/Witty' ('Soy hello,' 'Soy goodbye'). While clever, it breaks the immersion of the 'Cashmere' concept.",
      "evidence": "[TONE OF VOICE] Strategy: 'Hype Beast (Dreamy)' vs. Reality: 'Witty (Pun-based)'",
      "why_matters": "Puns are intellectual; Scents are emotional. When you force the customer to process a wordplay joke, you pull them out of the sensory imagination required to sell a fragrance product online.",
      "do_this_now": "Retire the 'Soy hello' puns in the product description text. Replace them with immersive sensory adjectives like 'Velvety,' 'Melting,' and 'Wrapper-soft' to align with the 'Cashmere' promise."
