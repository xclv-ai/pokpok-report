      "gap_description": "The Strategy defines the purchase as 'The Smart Choice' (2/5)—a rational decision based on price and efficacy. On Amazon, the 'Statement' slider jumps to 4/5, fueled by the #1 Best Seller badge and viral fame. You are selling 'Logic' on the site, but selling 'Status' on Amazon.",
      "evidence": "[SELF-EXPRESSION] Strategy: 'The Smart Choice (2/5)' vs. Reality: 'The Statement (4/5)'",
      "why_matters": "While being 'Cool' drives volume now, status is fragile. If the viral heat fades, the customer is left with a product they bought for the 'Badge' rather than the 'Value.' You risk becoming a fad rather than the 'Family Staple' you aim to be.",
      "do_this_now": "Reinforce the 'Smart Choice' logic in the A+ content. Don't just show the 'Best of Beauty' badge; explicitly pair it with the '24-hour hydration' and 'Sustainable Shea' claims to remind the buyer that the product works, regardless of the hype."

The Amazon template forces this into a 'Dynamic Grid' (3/5), boxing the fluidity. You are promising a cloud-like texture but displaying it in a spreadsheet structure.",

      "evidence": "[KEY SELLING POINTS] Strategy: 'The Users (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'The Fans (5/5)'",
      "why_matters": "Reliance on 'Fan' energy attracts trend-chasers who churn quickly. To build the 'Gentle Giant' staple brand, you need to convert 'Fans' (who love the brand) into 'Users' (who rely on the product).",
      "do_this_now": "In the review highlight section of the A+ content, filter for reviews that mention long-term use (e.g., 'Been using this for years') rather than just enthusiastic first-impressions (e.g., 'TikTok made me buy it')."
