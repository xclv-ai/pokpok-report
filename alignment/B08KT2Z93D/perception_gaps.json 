The brand has successfully shed the clinical sterility of the lotion aisle, replacing it with a colorful, tactile experience that feels like a hug. However, the 'Cheeky/Witty' edge found on the website is smoothed over into 'Polite Comfort,' making the brand feel more like a nice mom than a cool best friend.",

Your PDP, however, reverts to 'The Safe Harbor,' prioritizing defensive claims like 'Paraben/Phthalate Free.' You are trading the romance of the product for a safety checklist, assuming the customer is scared rather than excited.",

The PDP executes 'The Warm Companion,' which is supportive but lacks the 'Cheeky' edge. You have sanitized the personality to be 'Nice' for the mass market, losing the specific Gen-Z resonance.",
