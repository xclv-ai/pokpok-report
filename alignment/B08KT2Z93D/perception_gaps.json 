    "score_summary": "Scoring an impressive 86/100 (Healthy Condition), eos demonstrates rare strategic coherence between its 'Cool Girl' website and its 'Mass Market' Amazon presence. The only significant friction points lie in Positioning and Values, where the brand trades its 'Aesthetic Status' for 'Bulk Utility' to win the Amazon algorithm.",

    "narrative": "On Amazon, eos feels like the 'Internet's Favorite Lotion'—accessible, fun, and reliable. It successfully avoids the sterile 'medical' feel of competitors like CeraVe by maintaining high-dopamine visuals (swirls, pastels) and sensory language ('nuzzly', 'cozy'). It does not feel like a 'treatment'; it feels like a 'treat' that happens to be affordable. The vibe is less 'Exclusive Drop' and more 'Target Run Essential,' acting as a safe, joyful staple for the masses.",

      "gap_description": "On your Website, you position the brand as 'The Clean Essentialist'—a trendy lifestyle accessory that signals status (Positioning Score: 5/5 Aesthetic). On Amazon, this degrades into 'The Gentle Giant'—a volume-based family staple. You are losing the 'Cool Factor' that justifies the brand premium.",
      "evidence": "[POSITIONING] Strategy: 'The Clean Essentialist (Trendy Status)' vs. Reality: 'The Gentle Giant (Family Staple)'",
      "why_matters": "When a brand becomes too much of a 'commodity staple,' it loses pricing power and becomes vulnerable to generics. You want to be the lotion people *post* about, not just the one they *use*.",
      "do_this_now": "Reintroduce 'Vanity' elements to the PDP. Swap the 'At a Glance' image of the bottle scale/volume with a lifestyle shot of the bottle in a stylized 'Shelfie' context to remind the Amazon shopper that this is an aesthetic choice, not just a bulk buy."

      "headline": "Confusing Conscience with Science",
      "gap_description": "Your Target strategy emphasizes ethical safety (PETA, Gluten-Free, Paraben-Free), appealing to the conscious Gen-Z shopper. Your PDP pivots to clinical safety (Dermatologist-recommended, Hypoallergenic), appealing to the worried mom. You are splitting your brand equity between 'Activist' and 'Doctor'.",
      "why_matters": "Diluted values lead to diluted loyalty. The Gen-Z shopper buying for 'Cruelty-Free' may feel alienated by the sudden pivot to 'Clinical Authority' which feels less personal and more corporate.",
      "do_this_now": "Harmonize the badges. Ensure the 'Cruelty-Free' and 'Sustainable Shea' badges are visually co-located with the 'Dermatologist Recommended' claim in the secondary images to bridge the gap between Ethical Care and Clinical Care."

      "why_matters": "Being the 'Safe Choice' is great for volume but bad for hype. If everyone uses it, it's no longer a signal of unique taste. You risk boring the early adopters who made you famous.",
      "do_this_now": "Leverage the 'Pro Tip' layering content more aggressively. Frame the product not just as a 'Best Seller' but as a 'Base Layer' for unique scent combinations. This gives the user agency to be unique ('The Trend Setter') even while buying a mass product."

      "gap_description": "The Website is a 5/5 on the 'Warmth' scale—pure tactile emotion. The PDP cools down to a 4/5 due to the intrusion of Amazon's rigid UI and the 'Feature/Benefit' graphics. The clinical reality of the platform is chilling your sensory story.",
      "why_matters": "Your brand wins on 'Vibes.' Any reduction in visual warmth reduces the dopamine hit that triggers the impulse buy.",
