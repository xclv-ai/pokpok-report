However, a critical fracture exists in the Messaging Territory: the Website sells 'Sensory Persuasion' (The Dream), while Amazon pivots hard to 'The Value Hacker' (The Deal), risking long-term brand equity for short-term conversion.",

    "narrative": "On Amazon, eos feels like the 'Internet's Best Kept Secret' revealed. It sheds the high-gloss editorial distance of the website to become a hyper-accessible, conspiratorial best friend. The vibe is less about a transformative spa ritual and more about a clever 'Life Hack'—getting a luxury scent profile for less than the cost of a latte. It is dopamine-heavy, tactile, and incredibly persuasive, but it trades 'Aspiration' for 'Smart Shopping.'",

      "gap_description": "Your Website operates in the Territory of 'Sensory Persuasion,' hooking users with the emotional promise of 'Whipped Vanilla' and 'Cozy' feelings. Your PDP, however, shifts into 'The Value Hacker' territory, emphasizing the '$9.98' price point and the concept of a 'Dupe.' You are retraining your premium customer to view your product not as an indulgence, but as a bargain.",
      "evidence": "[MESSAGING] Strategy: 'Sensory Persuasion (The Dream)' vs. Reality: 'The Value Hacker (High End for Low Cost)'",
      "why_matters": "When you win on 'Value Hack,' you lose pricing power. You are currently the 'Smart Choice,' but this makes you vulnerable to the next cheaper competitor. You must maintain the 'Dream' even on Amazon to protect your margins.",

On Amazon, this drifts to 'Optimization' (Your Routine), focusing on 'Layering' and 'Pro-tips.' The focus shifts from the biological benefit to the performative ritual.",
      "evidence": "[MISSION] Strategy: 'Micro-Correction (1/5)' vs. Reality: 'Optimization (2/5)'",
      "why_matters": "While 'Routine' sells well on social media, 'Skin Health' drives retention. If users buy it for the 'Layering Trend' and the trend dies, you lose the customer. If they buy it because it fixes their skin, they stay forever.",
      "do_this_now": "Inject clinical authority back into the 'About this item' section. Add a specific bullet point focused solely on the *biological* mechanism of Shea Butter and the 7-oil blend, stripped of any 'layering' or 'scent' rhetoric, to ground the viral hype in efficacy."

      "gap_description": "Your Visual Identity relies on 'Gen-Z Pop'—warm, radiating pastels and organic shapes. Amazon's white-background requirement forces a 'Sterile' main image that conflicts with your 'Dopamine' code. The primary entry point feels colder and more generic than your brand promise.",
