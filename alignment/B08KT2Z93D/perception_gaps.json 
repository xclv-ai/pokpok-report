    "score_summary": "With a score of 65/100, the brand is in a 'Guarded Condition.' While the visual and tonal execution (the Vibe) is nearly perfect, the strategic bedrock (Mission, Values, Positioning) is fractured, with the PDP aggressively outpacing the conservative Target strategy.",

    "narrative": "On Amazon, eos appears as a high-dopamine, Gen-Z 'candy store' for the body. It completely sheds the sterile 'drugstore lotion' stigma, presenting itself as an edible, tactile, and highly social lifestyle accessory. The vibe is 'Bestie in the Group Chat'—using slang like 'hoo-has' and focusing intensely on the sensory pleasure of the application rather than the clinical science of the absorption. It feels like affordable luxury (Masstige) rather than a utilitarian daily staple.",

      "gap_description": "Your Strategy dictates a defensive 'Safety First' posture (Paraben-free, Hypoallergenic), but your PDP plays a high-stakes offensive game built on 'Heritage & Craft' (Wild-grown, Ghana, Sustainability). You are trying to soothe anxious customers in the boardroom, but inspiring activist customers on the shelf.",
      "evidence": "[VALUES] Strategy: 'Safety First (The Safe Harbor)' vs. Reality: 'Heritage & Craft (The Trusted Tradition)'",
      "why_matters": "Defensive claims ('Free from X') are now table stakes. By not aligning the Strategy to the PDP's bold narrative, you risk confusing the customer who seeks 'Clean' with the one who seeks 'Ethical.'",
      "do_this_now": "Update the WWW strategy to match the Amazon reality. Move 'Wild-Grown' and 'Sustainably Sourced' to the top of the hierarchy across all channels, making 'Safety' a quiet support pillar rather than the lead value."

      "gap_description": "The Strategic Target is 'The Gentle Giant' (a polished family staple), but the PDP executes as 'The Clean Essentialist' (a trendy status symbol). The Strategy aims for the medicine cabinet; the PDP aims for the TikTok 'Get Ready With Me' shelf.",
      "evidence": "[POSITIONING] Strategy: 'The Gentle Giant (Family Staple)' vs. Reality: 'The Clean Essentialist (Trendy Status)'",
      "why_matters": "A 'Family Staple' competes on price against Jergens. A 'Trendy Status' symbol competes on brand equity against Sol de Janeiro. You are currently priced for the former but acting like the latter.",
      "do_this_now": "Lean into the PDP's 'Masstige' positioning. Remove generic 'Family' cues from the strategy and officially pivot to 'Affordable Luxury' to protect your ability to launch higher-margin SKUs later."

      "gap_description": "Your Target KSPs rely on 'Authority' (Dermatologist Recommended) and 'Formula Purity,' but the PDP wins on 'Community' (44k ratings) and 'Sensory Experience' (The Feel). You are strategically selling a doctor's visit, but tactically selling a spa day.",
      "evidence": "[KEY SELLING POINTS] Strategy: 'Formula Purity (Proof: Safety)' vs. Reality: 'Sensory Experience (Proof: Pleasure)'",
      "why_matters": "The 'Derm-Recommended' seal is invisible to a consumer blinded by 'Whipped Vanilla' visuals. Over-indexing on clinical authority dilutes the fun, sensory brand equity you have successfully built.",
      "do_this_now": "Demote the 'Dermatologist Recommended' badge to the secondary image stack. Lead the A+ content with the 'Sensory Experience'—visualizing the texture and scent notes—and use the review count as the primary trust signal."

      "gap_description": "Your Mission Strategy is 'The Democratizers' (Access to skin health), but the PDP has drifted into 'The Earth Saviors' (Global/Societal Impact). The PDP spends significant real estate on the 'Shea Better' sustainability program in Ghana, which is a massive deviation from a simple 'skin health' mission.",
      "evidence": "[MISSION & VISION] Strategy: 'The Democratizers (Optimization)' vs. Reality: 'The Earth Saviors (Industry Reform)'",
      "why_matters": "If the social impact story is just 'fluff' on the PDP and not core to the Strategy, it will eventually feel inauthentic. Consumers will dig for the receipt on your 'Empowerment' claims.",
      "do_this_now": "The PDP is right; the Strategy is boring. Elevate the 'Shea Better' sustainability program to a core pillar of the corporate Brand Purpose immediately to substantiate the Amazon claims."
