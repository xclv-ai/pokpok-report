      "gap_description": "On your website, purchasing eos is framed as 'The Smart Choice' (2/5)—a rational decision to get high-quality shea for cheap. On Amazon, the #1 Best Seller badge and 54k+ ratings reframe the purchase as 'The Statement' (4/5). It shifts from a grocery add-on to a viral cultural flex, signaling that the buyer is plugged into the zeitgeist.",
      "evidence": "[SELF-EXPRESSION] Strategy: 'The Smart Choice (2/5)' vs. Reality: 'The Statement (4/5)'",
      "why_matters": "This is a positive gap, but it requires management. If you lean too hard into 'Smart/Cheap' on your DTC, you undercut the 'Cool/Viral' status you've accidentally achieved on Amazon. You risk treating a fan-favorite product like a commodity.",
      "do_this_now": "Update the website product page to include a 'Viral Favorite' or 'As Seen on TikTok' badge near the price. Lean into the status symbol aspect rather than just the value proposition."

      "headline": "Structured Swirls",
      "gap_description": "Your Visual Identity strategy relies on 'Playful Entropy' (4/5)—ingredients floating in mid-air and cream swirling without boundaries. Amazon's rigid gallery grid forces a slightly more 'Dynamic' but structured presentation (3/5). The feeling of 'Whipped' abundance is slightly contained by the white borders of the e-commerce interface.",
      "evidence": "[VISUAL IDENTITY] Strategy: 'Playful (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Dynamic (3/5)'",
      "why_matters": "When you sell texture ('Whipped'), containment is the enemy. The grid makes the product look heavier and more solid than the 'cloud-like' promise of the visual strategy.",
      "do_this_now": "Use 'break-the-grid' techniques in your Amazon A+ Content. Allow cream textures to span across multiple modules or use PNG transparency to make ingredients appear to float over the module dividers."

      "headline": "Validation vs. Phenomenon",
      "gap_description": "Your strategy targets 'The Users' (4/5) as validators—people who use and like the product. But on Amazon, with 54,000 ratings, you have graduated to 'The Fans' (5/5). This isn't just user approval; it is a swarm event. The PDP reflects a cultural phenomenon that the website's standard review widget fails to capture.",
      "evidence": "[KEY SELLING POINTS] Strategy: 'The Users (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'The Fans (5/5)'",
      "why_matters": "Treating your Amazon presence as just 'good reviews' undersells the asset. You have 'Social Proof Dominance' that competitors cannot replicate. The website feels quiet compared to the roar of the Amazon listing.",
      "do_this_now": "Create a 'Cult Favorite' module on the PDP that specifically highlights the sheer volume of 5-star reviews across platforms. Don't just show the stars; show the *number* of stars as a headline claim."

      "gap_description": "The Tone of Voice is highly aligned, but the PDP pushes the 'Formality' slider slightly further into 'Slang' (5/5) compared to the website's 'Conversational' (4/5). Phrases like 'Pro tip' and the imperative 'Relax' on Amazon feel slightly more internet-native than the descriptive copy on the site.",
      "evidence": "[TONE OF VOICE] Strategy: 'Conversational (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Slang (5/5)'",
      "why_matters": "Amazon shoppers scan quickly; slang works as a shortcut to affinity. The website copy, while friendly, feels slightly more traditional. You risk the website feeling like the 'corporate parent' of the 'cool Amazon sibling.'",
      "do_this_now": "Inject more imperative, punchy slang into the website's key benefit headers. Change 'Provides 24-hour hydration' to 'Get 24 hours of moisture, instantly.'"

      "headline": "The Curse of Consensus",
      "gap_description": "Both channels aim for 'The Safe Choice' (Social Benefits), but on Amazon, the scale of the 'Majority' tribe is overwhelming. While this drives conversion, it risks eroding the 'Indulgence' (Emotional Benefit) marker. When *everyone* uses it, it feels less like a 'private sanctuary' and more like a public utility.",
      "evidence": "[SOCIAL BENEFITS] Strategy: 'Acceptance' vs. Reality: 'Mass Consensus'",
      "why_matters": "Ubiquity is the enemy of specialness. If eos becomes the 'Honda Civic of Lotions' (reliable/everywhere), you lose the ability to charge a premium or launch higher-tier products later.",
      "do_this_now": "Counterbalance the massive popularity with 'Intimacy.' In the A+ content, focus heavily on the *private* smell experience ('Just for you') to remind the user that despite the millions of bottles sold, this bottle is for *their* personal moment."
