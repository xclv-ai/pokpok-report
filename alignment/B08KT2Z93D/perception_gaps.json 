    "narrative": "On Amazon, EOS presents as a high-dopamine, Gen-Z 'bestie' brand that prioritizes vibes over clinical authority. It feels like a magazine editorial come to life—visually loud, textually cheeky ('hoo-has'), and aggressively sensory. The perception is not of a 'Clean Essentialist' product, but rather a 'Value Hack'—a way to get a premium, sustainable, 'it-girl' aesthetic for under $10. It feels accessible, fun, and slightly chaotic.",
