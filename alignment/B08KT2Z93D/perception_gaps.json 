      "gap_description": "On the website, purchasing is framed as a 'Smart Choice' (2/5) based on value and chemical intelligence. On Amazon, the presence of awards and #1 badges shifts the motivation to making a 'Statement' (4/5) about cultural relevance. You drift from selling 'Sense' to selling 'Status.'",
      "evidence": "[SELF-EXPRESSION] Strategy: 'The Smart Choice (2/5)' vs. Reality: 'The Statement (4/5)'",
      "why_matters": "While both work, selling 'Status' on a $9 item is risky—if the viral heat cools, the purchase motivation evaporates. The 'Smart Choice' is a more durable, evergreen driver than being a 'Trend-Setter.'",

      "headline": "Dampened Dopamine",
      "gap_description": "The strategy relies on 'Playful Entropy' (4/5)—swirls and movement—to trigger a sensory response. Amazon's rigid layout forces a 'Dynamic Grid' (3/5) structure that slightly sterilizes the 'Whipped' promise. You are selling fluidity, but the shelf feels structured.",
      "evidence": "[VISUAL IDENTITY] Strategy: 'Playful (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Dynamic (3/5)'",
      "why_matters": "Texture is your primary differentiator. If the visual layout becomes too organized, the subconscious cue of 'Whipped' and 'Creamy' is diminished, making the product feel like a standard lotion rather than a sensory treat.",
      "do_this_now": "Introduce 'sticker-style' transparent PNG overlays in the A+ content modules that break the module borders. Use swirling cream textures that appear to flow *over* the rigid grid lines to restore entropy."

      "gap_description": "The website uses 'The Users' (4/5) as a trusted community validator. On Amazon, the sheer volume of 54k+ ratings shifts this to 'The Fans' (5/5)—a massive, viral crowd. This subtle shift moves the brand from 'Trusted' to 'Hype,' which can feel less personal.",
      "evidence": "[KEY SELLING POINTS] Strategy: 'The Users (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'The Fans (5/5)'",

      "evidence": "[TONE OF VOICE] Strategy: 'Conversational (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Slang (5/5)'",
      "why_matters": "When a brand pushes slang too hard, it loses authority. You want to be the 'Cool Sister,' not the 'Trying-Too-Hard Aunt.' Excess slang on a transactional platform can distract from the efficacy claims.",
      "do_this_now": "Dial back the imperative slang commands in the body copy. Keep the 'Nuzzly' descriptors, but ensure the instructions for use remain 'Light' (3/5) rather than 'Hype' (5/5) to maintain professional credibility."

      "evidence": "[POSITIONING] Strategy: 'Polished (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Price Dominance'",
      "why_matters": "If the price becomes the loudest signal, you lose the 'Cashmere' promise. You become a commodity rather than an affordable indulgence.",
