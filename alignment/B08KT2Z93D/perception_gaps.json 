      "gap_description": "Your Strategy defines the purchase as an act of 'Trend-Setting' (Relevance), but the Amazon environment reframes it as 'Pragmatism' (Rationality). While the slider values match, the territory shift is fatal: you are trading cultural currency for volume. You are dangerously close to becoming a commodity staple rather than a viral desire.",
      "evidence": "[SELF-EXPRESSION] Strategy: 'The Trend-Setter (Relevance)' vs. Reality: 'The Pragmatist (Rationality)'",
      "why_matters": "When a brand shifts from 'Trending' to 'Pragmatic,' it loses pricing power and emotional stickiness. Gen-Z buys 'Cool' at any price, but they only buy 'Pragmatic' until a cheaper option appears.",
      "do_this_now": "Inject 'Social Proof' visuals into the image carousel immediately. Use 'As Seen on TikTok' style graphics or user-generated content (UGC) overlays to remind the Amazon shopper that this is a *viral* choice, not just a *budget* choice."

      "gap_description": "The WWW relies on 'The Users' (viral fame/fans) to validate quality, but the PDP retreats to 'The Certifiers' (PETA/Allure badges). While badges provide safety, they are cold corporate stamps, whereas your true brand equity lies in the warm, chaotic enthusiasm of your fanbase.",

      "do_this_now": "Deprioritize the PETA/Allure logos to the second tier. Lead the graphic hierarchy with '50,000+ 5-Star Reviews' or 'The Internet's Favorite Lotion' to center the narrative on User Validation."

      "gap_description": "Your visual identity relies on 'Entropy' (swirls/movement) to convey the 'Whipped' texture, but Amazon's stricter grid layout lowers this energy (Entropy 3/5 vs 4/5). You are selling a sensory texture, but showing a structured box, dampening the 'dopamine' hit.",
      "evidence": "[VISUAL IDENTITY] Strategy: 'Playful Entropy (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Dynamic Grid (3/5)'",
