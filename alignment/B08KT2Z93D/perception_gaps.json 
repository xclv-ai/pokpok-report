      "gap_description": "On your Strategy/Site, purchasing eos is a signal of 'The Trend-Setter' (Relevance)—you buy it because it is culturally hot. On Amazon, the low price ($9.98) and massive review count (53k+) reframe the purchase as 'The Pragmatist' (Rationality)—you buy it because it is cheap and safe. You are risking the 'cool factor' for volume.",
