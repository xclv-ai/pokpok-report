    "narrative": "This product page feels less like a pharmacy aisle and more like a TikTok trend manifested in physical form. It radiates a high-dopamine, 'bestie' energy that is immediately disarming and aggressively sensory. The brand doesn't try to out-science the competition; instead, it overwhelms the user with 'yummy' visuals and a promise of affordable indulgence, effectively positioning itself as a guilt-free treat rather than a medical necessity.",

  "Purpose": {
    "alignment": "30%",
    "so_what": "Strategic Fracture. The PDP attempts to sound more clinical ('Bio-Active') than the brand's 'Natural Balance' soul intended. You are over-correcting for the Amazon algorithm."
  },
  "Mission & Vision": {
    "alignment": "90%",
    "so_what": "High Stability. The 'Democratization' mission is loud and clear. The price point and accessibility on Amazon perfectly execute the vision of mass-market luxury."
  },
  "Values": {
    "alignment": "30%",
    "so_what": "Identity Crisis. You have traded your 'Craft' values for 'Safety' values. While safety is important, it shouldn't overshadow the sensory experience that makes the brand unique."
  },
  "Positioning": {
    "alignment": "100%",
    "so_what": "Flawless Execution. The 'Masstige' positioning is hit perfectly. The product looks expensive but is priced cheaply, maintaining the 'Clean Essentialist' status."
  },
  "Visual Identity": {
    "alignment": "100%",
    "so_what": "Perfect Match. The 'Gen-Z Pop' visuals are consistent. The colors, curves, and lighting on the PDP mirror the DTC site exactly, delivering a strong dopamine hit."
  },
  "Personality": {
    "alignment": "100%",
    "so_what": "Perfect Match. The 'Trusted Friend' voice is alive and well. The use of 'Pro tips' and casual imperatives keeps the peer-to-peer dynamic intact."
  },
  "Archetypes Mix": {
    "alignment": "100%",
    "so_what": "High Stability. The dominant 'Lover' archetype (sensory focus) is well-supported by the 'Jester' (fun) and 'Caregiver' (protection), mirroring the strategic intent."
  },
  "Tone of Voice": {
    "alignment": "100%",
    "so_what": "Perfect Match. The 'Hype Beast' tone is consistent. The enthusiasm, slang, and direct address create a cohesive voice across channels."
  },
  "Messaging": {
    "alignment": "15%",
    "so_what": "Critical Failure. This is the biggest gap. You stopped selling 'The Dream' and started selling 'The Feature.' The romance is lost in the bullet points."
  },
  "Narrative / Story": {
    "alignment": "40%",
    "so_what": "Strategic Drift. The narrative has shifted from a 'Cultural Ritual' to a 'Green Lab' optimization story. It's less soulful and more functional."

  "Key Selling Points (KSP)": {
    "alignment": "90%",
    "so_what": "High Stability. You successfully rely on 'Sensory Experience' and 'Peer Validation' (reviews) to sell, which aligns with the strategy."

  "USP": {
    "alignment": "100%",
    "so_what": "Perfect Match. The 'Value Hacker' proposition is undeniable. High-end ingredients + Low price is the clear winning formula on both channels."

  },
  "Emotional Benefits": {
    "alignment": "85%",
    "so_what": "Stable. While the PDP pushes 'Status/Savvy' a bit more than 'Comfort,' the core emotional payoff of 'Delight' remains the primary hook."

  "Self-Expression Benefits": {
    "alignment": "90%",
    "so_what": "High Stability. The product successfully signals 'Trend-Setter' relevance. Buying it feels like joining a viral movement."

  "Social Benefits": {
    "alignment": "100%",
    "so_what": "Perfect Match. The 'Safe Choice' territory is secured. The massive review count validates the user's desire to belong to the mainstream crowd."
