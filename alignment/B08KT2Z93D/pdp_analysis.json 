    "reasoning": "The brand isn't trying to cure a skin disease; it's trying to make your skin feel 'delicious.' While they use 'Dermatologist-recommended' as a baseline, the real drive is the 'wild-grown natural shea' combined with the sensory elevation of 'Vanilla Cashmere.' They aren't just fixing dry skin; they are turning a chore (lotioning) into a 'sweet and nuzzly' treat.",
