    "description": "eos masters the art of 'Masstige' by wrapping commodity ingredients in high-dopamine aesthetics. It democratizes the sensory experience of luxury (Cashmere, Whipped, Sensual) into a $10 daily staple. It feels like a viral internet recommendation from a best friend—reliable, fun, and accessible, playing the role of the 'Lover' who believes self-care shouldn't cost a fortune."

      "title": "The Gentle Harmonizer",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the garden (Shea), rejecting clinical coldness for bio-active warmth. It balances this with a 'Safety First' value system, heavily emphasizing hypoallergenic and sensitive-skin friendliness. The strategy is pure Masstige—offering a 'Polished' visual experience at a 'Democratic' price point."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Intimate Enthusiast",
      "description": "There is zero distance between brand and user; the tone is 'Nuzzly', 'Cozy', and peer-to-peer. Dominated by The Lover archetype (65%), it projects intimacy and sensory pleasure through a Gen-Z Pop visual identity. The voice is a Hype Beast—enthusiastic, casual, and laden with 'pro tips' and exclamation points."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Sensory Alchemist",
      "description": "The messaging ignores molecular data to focus on Evocative persuasion, selling the 'Dream' of the scent (Vanilla Cashmere). The USP is the Ingredient King—owning the mental link to 'Shea' in the mass market. The narrative creates a 'Green Lab' origin, where nature is optimized for pleasure rather than just pathology."

      "title": "Indulgent Contentment",
      "description": "Functionally, it acts as a Restorer, soothing dry skin with 24-hour moisture. However, the true payoff is Emotional Indulgence—a private moment of 'delight' in the bathroom. Socially, it represents The Safe Choice, allowing users to join the massive 'Best of Beauty' majority without financial risk."
