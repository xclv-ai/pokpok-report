    "reasoning": "The brand creates a 'Third Way' between medical dermatology and raw nature. It heavily leverages 'Natural Shea' and '7 nourishing oils' (Nature) but processes them into a '24-hour moisture' system that focuses on sensory pleasure ('Sweet and nuzzly', 'Vanilla Cashmere') rather than just fixing dry skin pathology. It's about bringing your skin into a state of 'better' balance through enjoyable nature.",
