    "description": "eos masters the art of 'Sensory Masstige'—delivering a high-end, gourmand fragrance experience (Vanilla Cashmere) with a clean ingredient deck (Natural Shea) at a drugstore price point. It positions itself not as a clinical fixer, but as a 'nuzzly' indulgence that transforms a daily chore into a dopamine-rich ritual. The brand feels like an enthusiastic best friend who just found a luxury dupe and can't wait to tell you about it."

      "title": "The Gentle Harmonizer",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the garden ('Sustainable Natural Shea') rather than the lab, positioning itself as a Harmonizer that restores balance to dry skin. It adopts a Masstige strategy, democratizing the aesthetic codes of luxury (pastel packaging, complex fragrance) for the mass market. The value system creates a Safe Harbor, sacrificing aggressive potency for guaranteed gentleness and sensory pleasure."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Hype-Beast Lover",
      "description": "Dominated by The Lover archetype (65%), the brand speaks the language of intimacy ('Nuzzly', 'Cozy', 'Sensual') to trigger desire. The tone is The Hype Beast—enthusiastic, conversational, and cheeky ('Pro tip: Layer this!'). Visually, it balances Warmth and Structure, using an Earthy Organic palette of pastels to signal softness while maintaining a clean, approachable shelf presence."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Romantic Alchemist",
      "description": "The messaging Hook is the ingredient ('Shea Better'), but the Persuasion is purely Evocative, using poetic language ('Whipped vanilla', 'Soft musk') to sell the dream. The USP establishes the brand as The Ingredient King of Shea, while the Focus leans heavily into Lifestyle Aesthetic, prioritizing mood and texture over deep education."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Indulgent Hydration",
      "description": "Functionally, the product offers Hydration and Maintenance, keeping skin balanced and protected. However, the true psychological payoff is Indulgence—a 'Sanctuary' moment of private delight. Socially, it represents The Safe Choice, allowing users to join the 'Trending' tribe of 54,000+ fans without financial or dermatological risk."
