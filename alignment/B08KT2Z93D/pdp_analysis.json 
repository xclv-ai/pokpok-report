      "title": "The Gentle Harmonizer",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the garden ('Sustainable Shea') rather than the clinic, acting as a Harmonizer that balances biology with comfort. By adopting a Masstige strategy, it elevates a commodity product (lotion) into a 'nuzzly' ritual without the premium price tag. It promises Safety First through gentle, dermatologist-tested formulas that prioritize tolerance over aggression."

Socially, it represents The Safe Choice, allowing users to join a massive tribe of fans (#1 Best Seller) while signaling they are 'in the know' with viral trends."
