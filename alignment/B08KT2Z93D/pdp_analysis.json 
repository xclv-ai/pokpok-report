    "description": "eos is the master of 'Sensory Masstige.' It takes the codes of high-end indulgence—gourmand scents, whipped textures, and aesthetic packaging—and delivers them at a commodity price point ($9.98). It plays the role of the hyper-enthusiastic best friend who just found a 'dupe' for a luxury spa treatment. It doesn't sell skin health; it sells a daily dopamine hit that happens to moisturize."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Gentle Harmonizer",
      "description": "The brand rejects the sterile lab to anchor its authority in the garden (Shea), positioning itself as a Harmonizer that balances nature with efficacy. By adopting a Masstige strategy, it democratizes the concept of a 'ritual'—making 'Vanilla Cashmere' luxury accessible to the Target shopper. The payoff is simple: you feel pampered without feeling guilty about the price."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Sensual BFF",
      "description": "The psychological distance is zero; the brand speaks like a text message from a close friend ('Nuzzly', 'Soy hello'). Dominated by The Lover archetype (65%), it uses Gen-Z Pop visuals to trigger sensory desire. The voice is a Witty Guide, using puns and warmth to make skincare feel like fun rather than a chore."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Aromatic Alchemist",
      "description": "The hook is almost entirely olfactory—selling the 'Dream' of smelling like a bakery rather than the science of lipid barriers. The USP is the Ingredient King, claiming ownership of 'Shea' in the mass market. The narrative bypasses the founder to focus on the 'Harvest,' optimizing natural ingredients for a Lifestyle Aesthetic that prioritizes 'shelfie' appeal."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Low-Risk Indulgence",
      "description": "Functionally, it acts as a Hydrator, maintaining moisture balance through '24H' claims. The real payoff is Emotional Indulgence—a private moment of 'cozy' safety. Socially, it represents The Safe Choice; with 53,000+ reviews, it's the viral standard that signals you are 'in the know' without taking a financial risk."
