    "description": "eos feels like a dopamine hit for the mass market—a brand that successfully translates 'luxury' sensory codes (Cashmere, Whipped, Vanilla) into a fun, accessible grocery store staple. It differentiates by rejecting clinical boredom in favor of 'nuzzly' warmth and joy. It plays the role of the enthusiastic best friend who turns a daily chore into a moment of affordable indulgence."

      "title": "The Gentle Harmonizer",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the garden (Sustainable Shea) rather than the lab, positioning itself as a Harmonizer that restores balance through nature. Its value system is Safety First, sacrificing aggressive potency for guaranteed comfort and tolerance. The strategy is pure Masstige—democratizing the 'spa experience' at a $9 price point."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Hype-Beast Lover",
      "description": "There is zero psychological distance here; the brand speaks like a peer in a group chat. Dominated by The Lover archetype (65%), it seduces with sensory language ('Nuzzly', 'Sensual') while The Jester (20%) keeps it fun and colorful. The visual identity is Gen-Z Pop—using pastel dopamine colors to signal joy rather than clinical rigor."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Romantic Alchemist",
      "description": "The messaging ignores molecular science to focus on Evocative persuasion, selling the 'Dream' of the scent and texture. The USP is The Ingredient King, owning the mental link to 'Shea.' The narrative optimizes a natural harvest (Green Lab) to create a Lifestyle Aesthetic that prioritizes visual desire over education."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Indulgent Hydration",
      "description": "Functionally, it acts as a Maintainer, keeping moisture balanced without aggressive medical intervention. The real payoff is Emotional Indulgence, offering a private sanctuary of delight. Socially, it is The Safe Choice—allowing the user to signal relevance (Trend-Setter) without financial or social risk."
