    "description": "eos masters the art of 'Sensory Masstige'—delivering a high-dopamine, spa-like experience (Vanilla Cashmere, Whipped texture) at a strictly commodity price point. It feels like a playful, affectionate best friend rather than a clinical authority, using high-warmth language ('Nuzzly', 'Cozy') and Gen-Z visuals to make daily hydration feel like an indulgence rather than a chore."

      "title": "The Gentle Harmonizer",
      "description": "The brand rejects clinical sterility to position itself as a Harmonizer, anchoring its authority in 'Sustainable Natural Shea' while prioritizing a 'Safety First' value system for sensitive skin. The strategy is purely Masstige—democratizing the codes of luxury (Cashmere, Ritual) into a Daily Essential that dominates the category via accessibility."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Intimate Enthusiast",
      "description": "There is zero distance between brand and user. Dominated by The Lover archetype (65%), it projects genuine warmth through 'Nuzzly' language and a Gen-Z Pop visual code of pastel dopamine. The tone is The Hype Beast softened into a best friend—constantly enthusiastic ('Obsessed!'), cheeky, and informal."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Sensory Persuasion",
      "description": "The messaging ignores molecular data to sell The Dream of the scent ('Vanilla Cashmere', 'Sweet cream'). The USP is The Ingredient King, owning the mental link to 'Shea.' The narrative optimizes a natural harvest (The Green Lab) to create a Lifestyle Aesthetic that triggers desire through texture and mood rather than education."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Indulgent Restoration",
      "description": "Functionally, it acts as a Healer for dry skin, restoring moisture balance through 'Soothing' hydration. The real payoff is Emotional Indulgence—a private 'Sanctuary' moment of delight. Socially, it offers The Safe Choice—a pragmatic, mass-market badge that signals trend awareness without financial risk."
