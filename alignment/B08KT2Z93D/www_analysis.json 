  "reasoning": "The brand derives authority from nature—'Sustainably sourced shea', '7 nourishing oils', and 'Shea Butter' are the heroes, not clinical patents (Source of Power: 4/5 Bio-Active). However, the mission is purely sensory and aesthetic joy rather than medical repair—'Smells like whipped vanilla', 'Cozy caramel', and 'Soft musk' sell a dopamine hit and a 'vibe' rather than a cure for pathology (Mission Goal: 4/5 Enhancement). Nature-sourced + Dopamine-focused = The Empowerer, treating the mind through the senses.",
  "evidence": "Sustainably sourced shea... 7 nourishing oils... Smells like whipped vanilla... cozy caramel... soft musk... delicious scent",
