    "reasoning": "EOS doesn't just 'fix' dry skin; it gamifies the moisturizing experience. By combining 'Sustainable Shea' (Nature) with flavor profiles like 'Vanilla Cashmere' that mimic desserts, they shift the purpose from biological maintenance to sensory dopamine hits. It's about feeling 'cozy' and 'sweet', not just hydrated.",
