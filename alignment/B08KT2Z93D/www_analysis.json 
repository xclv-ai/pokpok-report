  "reasoning": "This isn't medicine; it's a mood shift. The authority comes from the earth—'Sustainable natural shea', '7 nourishing oils'—but the goal is pure sensory elevation. They aren't fixing a disease; they are selling a vibe. 'Vanilla Cashmere', 'Whipped', and 'Nuzzly' don't repair your skin; they upgrade your reality. Plant power + Psychological elevation = The Empowerer.",
