  "Purpose": {
    "territory": "The Empowerer (Psychological Uplift)",
    "reasoning": "eos isn't just fixing dry skin; they are selling a 'mood.' By combining 'Sustainable wild-grown shea' with descriptors like 'whipped vanilla,' they elevate a basic biological maintenance task into a sensory treat. It's not medicine; it's a dopamine hit.",
    "evidence": "\"Smells like whipped vanilla, soft musk & cozy caramel... 24-hour hydration.\"",

  },
  "Mission & Vision": {
    "territory": "The Democratizers (Accessible Expertise)",
    "reasoning": "They are taking 'luxury' scents and 'natural' claims and making them hyper-accessible. They aren't trying to save the world, just your legs, and they want everyone to afford it.",

  },
  "Values": {
    "territory": "Heritage & Craft (The Trusted Tradition)",
    "reasoning": "They tick the safety boxes ('Derma-Tested', 'Hypoallergenic'), but the value prop is heavily curated around the story of the scent and the 'wild-grown' sourcing. It's less about the chemical percentage and more about the 'cozy' narrative.",
    "evidence": "\"Sustainable wild-grown shea... Vegan... Cruelty-free.\"",

  },
  "Positioning": {
    "territory": "The Clean Essentialist (The Trendy Status)",
    "reasoning": "It sits in the 'Masstige' sweet spot. It looks good enough for a shelfie (aesthetic) but functions as a daily workhorse (utilitarian). It's not 'medical'—it's 'yummy.'",

  "Visual Identity": {
    "territory": "Gen-Z Pop (Code: Dopamine)",

  "Key Selling Points (KSP)": {
    "territory": "Sensory Experience (Proof: Pleasure)",
