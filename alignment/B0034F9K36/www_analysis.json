Dominated by The Caregiver (60%) and Sage (30%) archetypes, it uses Pharma-Code visuals (blue, white, grid) to signal safety. The tone is Clinical Authority—dry, precise, and devoid of humor or slang."

The USP is The Specialist, owning the 'healing ointment' category with a specific semi-occlusive formula. The narrative is The Lab Breakthrough, relying on the 'Dermatologist Recommended' badge as the ultimate truth."
