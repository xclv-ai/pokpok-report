    "headline": "The Clinical Caregiver",
    "description": "Jergens occupies the trustworthy center of the skincare aisle, functioning as the 'Gentle Giant' that balances hospital-grade repair with family-friendly warmth. It doesn't sell luxury or vanity; it sells the competence of a dermatologist wrapped in the comfort of a daily staple. It is the pragmatist's choice for results without the theater."

      "title": "The Healing Authority",
      "description": "The brand is anchored firmly in The Healer territory, deriving authority from clinical efficacy ('Repairs & Heals') rather than nature. It balances this potency with a Safety First value system, validated by dermatologist testing. The positioning is classic Masstige—delivering medical-grade hydration at a commodity price point."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "Reliable Expert",
      "description": "The psychological distance is 'The Guide'—knowledgeable but accessible. Dominated by The Caregiver (60%) archetype, it projects a nurturing stability reinforced by a 'Pharma-Code' visual identity (white bottle) that is softened by skin-tone palettes. The tone is a Gentle Guide, prioritizing helpful, proven advice over entertainment."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Functional Problem Solver",
      "description": "The messaging uses a Rational Hook, focusing on the biology of '5 layers' and 'Vitamins' to justify the promise of repair. The USP is Tech-Engineered ('Hydralucence'), distinguishing it from generic lotions. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough story, building trust through scientific mechanism rather than founder lore."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Comfort",
      "description": "Functionally, it acts as a Restorer, fixing the broken barrier of extra-dry skin. The emotional payoff is Relief, offering the 'Sanctuary' of physical comfort after pain or tightness. Socially, it is The Safe Choice—a pragmatic badge of 'The Majority' that signals common sense over status."
