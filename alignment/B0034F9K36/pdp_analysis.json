      "title": "Democratic Guardian",
      "description": "The brand stands as a Guardian, using 'Hydralucence' science and vitamins to repair damage rather than just mask it.

      "title": "The Caregiver's Touch",
      "description": "The distance between brand and user is minimal; it acts as a Trusted Friend or parent. Dominated by The Caregiver archetype (60%), it projects warmth and reliability. The visual identity bridges the gap between Pharma-Code cleanliness and warm family photography, while the tone remains a Gentle Guide—helpful, professional, and reassuring."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Problem-Solving Science",
      "description": "The messaging acts as a Problem Solver, hooking the user with the promise of 'Repairing' extra dry skin. The USP is the 'Hydralucence Blend,' a Tech Engineer claim that creates a mental link to efficacy. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, citing '5 layers of penetration' to build trust through mechanism rather than founder stories."

      "title": "Restorative Comfort",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Fixer, aggressively repairing broken skin barriers. The Emotional payoff is Relief and Comfort—returning the user to a baseline of normalcy.
