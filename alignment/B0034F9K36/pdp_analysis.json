    "headline": "The Family Healer",
    "description": "Jergens is the warm, reliable matriarch of the bathroom cabinet. It eschews high-fashion pretensions and complex science for a straightforward promise: deep repair for the people you love. It feels like a hug in a bottle—accessible, effective, and centered on the visceral relief of 'fixing' dry skin rather than 'transforming' identity."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Democratic Healer",
      "description": "The brand positions itself as The Healer, treating dryness as a condition to be repaired rather than a flaw to be hidden. It combines this clinical goal with a Democratic mission, offering 'Ultra Healing' at a commodity price point ($10). It is The Gentle Giant—a massive, reliable presence that prioritizes family utility over exclusive status."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Nuturing Stabilizer",
      "description": "Jergens acts as The Caregiver (Stabilizer), offering certainty and protection in a chaotic world. The personality is a Trusted Friend—warm, inviting, and devoid of arrogance. Visually, it uses a 'Warm Comfort' aesthetic (Earthy Organic territory) to signal safety through soft oranges and whites rather than sterile blues."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Rational Problem Solver",
      "description": "The messaging is functional: it identifies a specific pain ('Extra Dry Skin') and offers a mechanical solution ('Penetrates 5 layers'). It relies on The Specialist USP, owning the 'Extra Dry' niche via its 'Hydralucence' complex. The focus is educational, teaching the user exactly how the repair happens."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Safety",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Fixer, repairing the skin barrier to restore health. The emotional payoff is Relief—the absence of discomfort and the return to 'normal.' Socially, it is The Safe Choice, a pragmatic badge of rationality that signals you make smart, proven decisions for your household."
