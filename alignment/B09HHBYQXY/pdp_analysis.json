    "description": "Amazon Basics strips away all narrative, romance, and ego to present the product as pure infrastructure. It feels like a public utility service rather than a consumer brand—reliable, standardized, and aggressively priced. It plays the role of the Generic Equalizer, proving that 'brand name' is a tax the smart customer doesn't need to pay."

      "title": "The Democratic Guardian",
      "description": "The brand rejects the need for 'Nature' or 'Story' to anchor authority, relying instead on the clinical standard of 'USP 100%'. It is a Safety First value system that prioritizes pure spec-sheet transparency. The strategy is The Medical Authority—positioning the product as a sterile, functional tool in the Medicine Cabinet, accessible to everyone."

      "title": "The Reliable Utility",
      "description": "There is a massive distance between brand and user; it behaves like a vending machine, not a friend. Dominated by The Everyman archetype, it uses Pharma-Code visuals (Drug Facts, Blue/White) to signal commodity status. The voice is The Clinical Authority—grave, direct, and purely informational."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "The Value Hacker",
      "description": "The messaging uses a 'Compare to' strategy, explicitly commoditizing the competition to focus on The Value Hack. The USP is the lack of a USP—it admits it is identical to the market leader (Vaseline) but cheaper. The narrative is non-existent (The Lab Breakthrough), relying entirely on the user's knowledge of the category."
