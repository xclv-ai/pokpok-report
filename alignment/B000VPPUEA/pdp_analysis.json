    "description": "Bio-Oil occupies a unique 'Medical Masstige' position—it looks and acts like a pharmaceutical prescription for scars, but sells at a commodity price point. It balances the 'Caregiver' role (nurturing pregnant bellies and damaged skin) with 'Sage' authority (clinical trials and dermatologist recommendations). It is the trusted, democratic default for skin correction, proving that serious skin repair doesn't need to be exclusive."

      "title": "The Democratic Healer",
      "description": "The brand's purpose is uncompromisingly corrective—existing to 'fix' pathologies like scars and stretch marks rather than just enhancing beauty. It democratizes this medical-grade restoration by making it accessible to the mass market ($10.26). Positioning is strictly Medical Authority; it sits mentally in the pharmacy aisle, not the beauty counter."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Reliable Expert",
      "description": "The persona is a serious, competent Expert who prioritizes results over fluff. The visual identity is 'Pharma-Code'—using a clinical white and 'Warning Orange' palette to signal potency and safety. The tone is professional and instructional, focusing on 'how-to' and 'proven results' rather than building an emotional friendship."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Problem-Solving Science",
      "description": "The messaging is functional: identifying a specific problem (Scars) and offering a mechanical solution. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, anchoring trust in the proprietary 'PurCellin Oil' technology. It relies heavily on Derm-Validation, using doctor recommendations as the primary currency of trust."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Corrective Relief",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Restorer, repairing the skin's barrier and appearance. Emotionally, it provides Relief and Reassurance during vulnerable times (pregnancy, injury). Socially, it is The Safe Choice—the overwhelming consensus product that signals you are taking pragmatic, responsible care of your skin."
