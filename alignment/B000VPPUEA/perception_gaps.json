    "gap_description": "Your Strategy defines the product's function as 'Restoration' (Recovery)—fixing a broken biological barrier. The PDP executes as 'Correction' (Perfection)—improving the visual appearance of scars. You are effectively selling a cosmetic solution to a customer who is looking for a medical cure.",
    "evidence": "[FUNCTIONAL BENEFITS] Strategy: 'Restoration (Outcome: 1/5 Biological)' vs. Reality: 'Correction (Outcome: 4/5 Aesthetic)'",
    "why_matters": "This is the most damaging gap. By shifting the promise from 'Healing' to 'Beautifying', you lose the urgency of the 'Panic Mode' purchaser who needs a wound fixed, and instead compete in the crowded 'Beauty/Anti-Aging' space where you have less authority.",

    "gap_description": "Your Strategy is led by 'The Caregiver' (60%)—warm, protective, and soothing. The PDP is hijacked by 'The Sage' (50%)—intellectual, instructional, and focused on proprietary technology ('PurCellin'). You have traded the warmth of protection for the coldness of a lecture.",
    "evidence": "[ARCHETYPES MIX] Strategy: Primary Caregiver (60%) vs. Reality: Primary Sage (50%)",
    "why_matters": "A 'Caregiver' brand builds loyalty through emotional safety ('I got you'). A 'Sage' brand builds respect through data. By leaning too hard into the science/tech aspect on the PDP, you alienate the user who is in pain and seeking comfort, turning a relational purchase into a transactional one.",

    "gap_description": "Your Strategy is built on 'Pure Clinical' authority (1/5)—simple, proven, sterile inputs. The PDP introduces 'Hybrid Science' (3/5) with narratives about bio-mimicry ('duck gland oil copy'). This complexity muddies the water, moving you from 'The Standard' to 'The Experiment'.",
    "evidence": "[PURPOSE] Strategy: 'The Healer (Origin: 1/5 Pure Clinical)' vs. Reality: 'The Healer (Origin: 3/5 Hybrid Science)'",
    "why_matters": "Simplicity is a feature of medical authority. When you start explaining complex bio-engineering, you sound less like a doctor and more like a biotech startup. This erodes trust with the pragmatic user who just wants the 'proven gold standard'.",

    "evidence": "[EMOTIONAL BENEFITS] Alignment: 90% | Risk: Anxiety slider drifting from 'Panic' (1/5) to 'Reassurance' (2/5)",
    "why_matters": "Panic buys have zero price sensitivity. Reassurance buys involve comparison shopping. If you lose the 'Panic' edge, you open the door for generic competitors. The drift from 'Fix it NOW' to 'Is it safe?' lowers the conversion velocity.",

    "evidence": "[SELF-EXPRESSION] Alignment: 100% | Opportunity: Maximize 'The Tool' signal (1/5)",
    "why_matters": "In a beauty industry obsessed with aesthetics, 'Radical Pragmatism' is a superpower. By trying to look too professional or 'clean' (PDP Aesthetic 2/5), you leave money on the table. The brand that owns 'Ugly but Effective' becomes the cult favorite for real problems.",
    "do_this_now": "Don't polish the A+ content too much. Use raw, unfiltered before/afters. Celebrate the 'goopiness' or the 'medical' feel. Make the product look like a heavy-duty tool, not a cosmetic serum. Own the medicine cabinet, not the vanity."
