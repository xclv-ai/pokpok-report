    "headline": "The Industrial Healer",
    "description": "Bio-Oil presents itself not as a beauty brand, but as a pharmaceutical engineering firm for human skin. The interface is stark, clinical, and aggressively minimalist, prioritizing 'Information' and 'Awards' over sensory allure.

    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Clinical Restorer",
      "description": "The brand is a Healer, focused entirely on the pathological correction of scars and stretch marks rather than aesthetic enhancement. It derives authority from the Lab, emphasizing 'PurCellin Oil' and precision manufacturing over natural sourcing. The strategy is Medical Authority, offering a democratized but highly specialized solution at a Masstige price point."

      "title": "The Sterile Specialist",
      "description": "The distance between brand and user is maximum—this is The Reliable Expert speaking down to the patient. Dominated by The Sage (70%) and Ruler (20%) archetypes, it uses a Pharma-Code visual identity (sterile whites, blurred machinery) to signal rigor. The tone is The Clinical Authority: dry, academic, and void of emotion."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Problem-Solving Science",
      "description": "The messaging ignores 'dreams' to focus entirely on The Problem (scars, stretch marks). The USP is The Specialist, claiming ownership of a niche condition rather than a generic category. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough story, using 'Information' tabs and manufacturing imagery to prioritize Education over inspiration."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Pragmatic Restoration",
      "description": "Functionally, it offers Restoration, fixing broken skin barriers and tissue damage.
