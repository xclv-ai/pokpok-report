    "headline": "The Clinical Pragmatist",
    "description": "Aquaphor is the ultimate utility player in the skincare world. It rejects all vanity and trendiness to occupy the position of the Medical Authority, offering a sterile, highly effective tool for urgent repair. It feels like a prescription you can buy without a doctor, solving skin crises with zero emotional fluff but absolute reliability."

      "title": "The Medical Authority",
      "description": "The brand derives its power entirely from the Clinic, citing '#1 Dermatologist Recommended' as its primary credential. Its purpose is purely Restorative—fixing broken, cracked skin rather than enhancing beauty. Positioned as a Daily Essential at a commodity price, it sacrifices all aesthetic 'shelfie' appeal for the visual codes of the pharmacy."

      "title": "The Sterile Caregiver",
      "description": "The brand maintains a Distant but Helpful dynamic, acting like a competent nurse rather than a friend. Dominated by The Caregiver (60%) and The Sage (25%) archetypes, it uses a Pharma-Code visual identity (sterile white and blue) to signal safety. The tone is The Clinical Authority—dry, factual, and devoid of humor."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Problem-Solving Science",
      "description": "The messaging leads with the Benefit ('Relief') backed by Rational persuasion ('Clinically proven'). The USP is the Form Factor—taking a trusted formula and making it 'mess-free' for on-the-go utility. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough story, focusing on the mechanism of the 'semi-occlusive' barrier rather than a founder's journey."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Urgent Restoration",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Fixer, repairing the skin barrier to stop pain. The emotional payoff is Relief—the absence of discomfort and the return to normalcy. It allows the user to signal Pragmatism, proving they prioritize what works over marketing hype, and places them firmly in The Safe Choice majority."
