      "title": "The Protective Harmonizer",
      "description": "The brand positions itself as a Harmonizer, utilizing 'Practitioner Grade' nature to restore energetic balance. By demonizing plastic ('lipophilic toxins'), it establishes a Safety First value system where the glass vessel is as important as the oil itself.

Visually, it owns an Earthy Organic aesthetic anchored by its signature Amber Glass and gold typography."

The USP is The Specialist, owning the specific niche of 'Castor Oil Packs' rather than just general oil. The narrative is a Green Lab story—'Designed by a Naturopathic Doctor' to optimize nature's potential."
