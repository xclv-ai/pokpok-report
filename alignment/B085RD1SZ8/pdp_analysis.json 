    "description": "Queen of the Thrones positions itself as the 'Practitioner Grade' gold standard in a sea of commodity oils. By combining the authority of a Naturopathic Doctor with a fear-based purity narrative (Glass vs. Plastic), it successfully commands a 300% price premium ($37.47 vs. ~$12 avg). It plays the role of the Wise Matriarch—educating you on invisible toxins while offering a royal, ritualistic solution for holistic health."

      "title": "The Holistic Guardian",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in a hybrid of 'Naturopathic Design' and 'Organic Purity' (The Harmonizer). It justifies its selective 'Practitioner Grade' price point through a radical Safety First value system, prioritizing 'Amber Glass' to protect against plastic leaching. This is The Scientific Vanguard of natural wellness—selling not just oil, but a toxin-free philosophy."

      "title": "The Royal Sage",
      "description": "Dominated by The Sage archetype (60%), the brand focuses on educating the user about 'lipophilic toxins' and 'energetic flow.'

      "description": "The messaging Hook is purely Feature-led ('Amber Glass', 'Hexane-Free') rather than benefit-led. The USP is The Specialist—owning the 'Castor Oil Pack' ritual for specific organs (Liver, Thyroid). The narrative focuses on The Green Lab, where a Naturopathic Doctor optimizes nature's harvest for clinical-grade safety."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Ritualistic Safety",
      "description": "Functionally, it offers Restoration and detox through the mechanism of 'Packs.' However, the primary payoff is Relief/Safety—the peace of mind that comes from avoiding plastic contaminants. It appeals to The Purist, allowing the user to signal their superior knowledge of wellness and commitment to a 'clean' lifestyle."
