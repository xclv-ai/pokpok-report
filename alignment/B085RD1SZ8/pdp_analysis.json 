    "description": "Queen of the Thrones elevates a commodity ingredient into a high-status medical ritual. By positioning itself as 'Practitioner Grade' and aggressively demonizing plastic packaging ('The choice is clear'), it creates a 'Purist' hierarchy where this brand sits alone at the top. It blends the clinical authority of a doctor with the spiritual language of 'energetic flow,' targeting the wellness elite who fear toxins more than they fear a $37 price tag."
