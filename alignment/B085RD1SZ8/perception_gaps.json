    "gap_description": "Your Website narrative is 'The Personal Cure'—anchored in Dr. Marisol's journey from illness to health. It gives the brand a soul. On Amazon, the narrative collapses into 'The Lab Breakthrough,' stripping away the Founder's story in favor of 'manufacturing processes' and 'materials standards.'",
    "evidence": "[NARRATIVE] Strategy: 'The Survivor (5/5)' vs. Reality: 'The Professional (2/5)'",
    "why_matters": "Dr. Marisol's story is the only thing that justifies paying $37 for castor oil. Without the emotional hook of her recovery, you are just selling a commodity at a 400% markup. You've removed the 'Queen' and left only the 'Oil.'",

    "gap_description": "On the website, you are 'The Trusted Friend'—warm, using emojis, talking about 'loving your liver.' On Amazon, you morph into 'The Reliable Expert'—distant, stern, and warning about 'lipophilic toxins.' You have traded intimacy for sterility.",

    "why_matters": "Your brand destigmatizes 'gross' topics (poop, periods) through warmth. By adopting a cold, clinical persona on Amazon, you make these topics shameful again. You are alienating the customer who needs a friend, not a lecture.",
    "do_this_now": "Inject warmth into the bullet points. Change 'Ditch the chemicals' to 'Love your body, not the bottle.' Add the 'Queen's' voice back into the product description—use words like 'Ritual,' 'Love,' and 'Flow' instead of just 'Process' and 'Standard.'"

    "evidence": "[TONE OF VOICE] Strategy: 'Gentle Guide' vs. Reality: 'Clinical Authority'",
    "why_matters": "Fear-based selling ('plastic is toxic') works for conversion, but it kills brand love. You are building customers who buy out of anxiety, not loyalty. If a competitor offers a 'safer' bottle for cheaper, these anxiety-driven customers will defect instantly.",

    "why_matters": "Safety is table stakes in the natural category; it doesn't justify a premium. 'Magic' (the ancient, transformative power of the oil) is what builds high perceived value.
