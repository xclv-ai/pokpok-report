The warmth and emojis are gone, replaced by grave warnings about chemicals. You are scaring the customer rather than welcoming them.",
    "evidence": "[PERSONALITY] Strategy: 'Affectionate (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Distant (2/5)'",
    "why_matters": "The 'Trusted Friend' persona builds loyalty and forgiveness. The 'Cold Clinician' only builds transactional trust. If you are too cold, you lose the 'cult' vibe that makes fans buy the entire ecosystem of packs and supplements.",

    "why_matters": "Safety is a baseline expectation, not a hook. The 'Magician' element—the ancient, legendary status of the oil—is what creates the mystique.
