    "evidence": "[PERSONALITY] Strategy: 'Affectionate (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Distant (2/5)'",
    "why_matters": "Wellness creates vulnerability. Customers buy from 'The Trusted Friend' because they feel understood. 'The Reliable Expert' commands respect but not loyalty.

    "evidence": "[TONE OF VOICE] Strategy: 'Witty/Cheeky (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Grave/Dry (1/5)'",
    "why_matters": "Humor is your moat. It makes talking about bowel movements acceptable. By stripping the humor on Amazon, you force the customer to confront the medical reality of 'liver packs' without the psychological cushion of wit. This increases the 'ick factor' and lowers conversion.",

    "evidence": "[POSITIONING] Strategy: 'Polished (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Professional (2/5)'",
