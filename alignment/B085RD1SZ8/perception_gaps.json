The market demands you pick a lane: either strip the neon 'Hype' from the website to own the high-trust medical niche (Option A), or modernize the Amazon presence to 'Masstige' and admit you are a lifestyle brand, not a clinic (Option B).

The data demands a ruthless pivot: either infect the website with the 'Anti-Plastic' fear narrative to drive urgency (Option A), or sanitize the Amazon page to be 'Safe' and lose your sharpest hook (Option B). Comfort is nice, but fear moves units."
