    "gap_description": "Your Strategy grounds the brand in 'The Green Lab' where authority comes from the 'Harvest' (4/5). On Amazon, you've stripped away the nature, presenting a sterile 'Lab Breakthrough' environment focused entirely on 'Tech-Forward' processing (2/5). You have traded the romance of the soil for the safety of the clean room.",
    "evidence": "[NARRATIVE] Strategy: 'Harvest (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Tech-Forward (2/5)'",

On Amazon, you have downgraded to claiming 'The Tech' (4/5)—specifically the amber glass protection. You are selling a 'better bottle' instead of a 'better life'.",
    "evidence": "[USP] Strategy: 'The System (5/5)' vs. Reality: 'The Tech (4/5)'",
    "why_matters": "Competitors can copy 'Amber Glass' (The Tech) easily. They cannot copy a proprietary 'Self-Care System' (The System). By focusing on the bottle specs, you lower the barrier for copycats to steal your market share with cheaper glass alternatives.",
