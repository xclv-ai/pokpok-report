      "description": "Your Strategy is built on the 'Hero's Journey' of Dr. Marisol—a survivor who healed herself. On Amazon, she is reduced to a generic 'Naturopathic Doctor' credential. You have erased the protagonist, turning a deeply personal 'Cure' narrative into a cold 'Lab Breakthrough' that lacks emotional resonance.",
      "evidence": "[NARRATIVE] Strategy: 'The Survivor (5/5)' vs. Reality: 'The Professional (2/5)'",
      "why_matters": "People trust people, especially in the 'natural cures' space. By hiding the founder's face and struggle, you lose the emotional hook that justifies the premium price. You become just another bottle of oil, rather than a ticket to the founder's healing circle.",

      "evidence": "[PERSONALITY] Strategy: 'Affectionate (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Distant (2/5)'",
      "why_matters": "The brand's magic is the 'Queen of the Thrones' persona—regal but warm. The clinical coldness of the PDP makes the brand feel corporate and severe, alienating the customer looking for 'self-care' and 'love.'",

You've stripped out the wit that makes the brand name clever, leaving just the awkwardness of a 'Throne' reference without the punchline.",
      "evidence": "[TONE OF VOICE] Strategy: 'Cheeky (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Grave (1/5)'",
      "why_matters": "Without the 'Cheeky' tone, the name 'Queen of the Thrones' risks sounding nonsensical or overly medieval rather than witty. The humor is a key differentiator in a category (laxatives/detox) that is usually embarrassing.",
