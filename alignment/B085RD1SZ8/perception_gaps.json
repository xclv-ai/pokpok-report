On Amazon, this narrative is wiped clean, replaced by 'The Lab Breakthrough' where the protagonist is a generic professional (2/5). You have traded a compelling human story for a cold specification sheet.",
      "evidence": "[NARRATIVE] Strategy: 'The Survivor (5/5)' vs. Reality: 'The Professional (2/5)'",
      "why_matters": "Dr. Marisol is your differentiation. Without her story, you are just selling expensive oil in a glass bottle. The 'Survivor' archetype justifies the premium; the 'Professional' is easily undercut by cheaper clinical brands.",

The PDP personality shifts to 'The Reliable Expert'—distant, stern, and warning-heavy (Thermostat 2/5). You are schizophrenic: hugging the customer on one channel and handing them a liability waiver on the other.",
      "evidence": "[PERSONALITY] Strategy: 'Affectionate (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Distant (2/5)'",
      "why_matters": "A 'Distant' personality makes the brand feel corporate and litigious ('If it doesn't test well... Period'). This erodes the 'Queen's' benevolent authority, making the brand feel colder and less accessible to the wellness beginner.",

      "evidence": "[TONE OF VOICE] Strategy: 'Enthusiastic (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Dry/Grave (2/5)'",
      "why_matters": "Fear-based selling works for commodities, but it kills brand love. By focusing heavily on what you *avoid* (toxins), you lose the emotional resonance of what you *gain* (vitality). You are training customers to be paranoid rather than loyal.",
      "action": "Rewrite the second bullet point to flip from Negative to Positive. Instead of focusing on 'preventing exposure,' focus on 'Preserving Purity.' Frame the glass bottle as a 'Vault for Nature's Gold' rather than just a shield against plastic."

      "evidence": "[FUNCTIONAL BENEFITS] Alignment: 90% | Risk: Action slider dropping from 5/5 (Strategy) to 4/5 (Reality)",
      "why_matters": "The price premium depends on the intensity of the benefit. 'Soothing' is worth $15. 'Liver Detox' and 'Systemic Repair' are worth $37. If the language softens further to avoid Amazon compliance flags, you lose the value proposition entirely.",
