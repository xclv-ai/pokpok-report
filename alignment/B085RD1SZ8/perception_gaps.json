      "evidence": "[NARRATIVE] Strategy: 'The Survivor (5/5)' vs. Reality: 'The Professional (2/5)'",
      "why_matters": "In the crowded wellness market, 'Clean Specs' are table stakes, but 'Founder Story' is the hook. By hiding the founder's struggle, you lose the empathetic connection that justifies a $37 price point for commodity oil. You become just another expensive bottle on the shelf.",

      "evidence": "[PERSONALITY] Strategy: 'Affectionate (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Distant (2/5)'",
      "why_matters": "A 'Distant' personality erodes loyalty. If the brand feels cold and transactional, the customer has no reason to stick around when a cheaper 'Hexane-Free' competitor appears. Warmth creates the switching cost.",

      "evidence": "[TONE OF VOICE] Strategy: 'Cheeky (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Grave (1/5)'",
      "why_matters": "Fear sells, but it doesn't build community. The 'Grave' tone makes the purchase feel like a medical necessity rather than a self-care ritual. You are losing the 'Cool Factor' that comes from the quirky 'Queen of the Thrones' branding by taking yourself too seriously.",

      "evidence": "[ARCHETYPES MIX] Alignment: 90% | Drift: Tertiary Magician (WWW) replaced by Caregiver (PDP)",
      "why_matters": "The 'Magician' archetype allows you to charge a premium for the *mystery* and *ritual* of the oil. The 'Caregiver' just sells safety. If you lose the magic completely, you lose the ability to enchant the customer, reducing the product to a utilitarian commodity.",
