      "description": "Your Strategy defines the brand as 'The Trusted Friend'—warm, affectionate (4/5), and approachable. On Amazon, you have stiffened into 'The Reliable Expert'—distant (2/5) and hyper-clinical. You have traded the persona of a 'wise aunt' for that of a 'strict doctor,' making the brand feel competent but cold.",
      "evidence": "[PERSONALITY] Strategy: 'Affectionate (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Distant (2/5)'",
      "why_matters": "Competence buys trial, but warmth buys loyalty. By removing the emotional heat ('The Thermostat'), you become a utility product rather than a relationship brand. Utilities are easily swapped for cheaper generics.",
      "action": "Inject warmth into the A+ Content 'Brand Story' module. Replace clinical language with 'Royal' hospitality terms (e.g., 'Welcome to the family,' 'Your self-care throne'). Use imagery of the founder engaging warmly, not just lab coats."

      "description": "The WWW sells 'Relief/Safety'—a visceral sanctuary from the anxiety of toxins. The PDP flips this to sell 'Intelligence'—the feeling of being savvy/educated. While being smart is nice, it is a weaker purchase driver than the primal need for safety and relief from physical discomfort.",
      "evidence": "[EMOTIONAL BENEFITS] Strategy: 'Sanctuary (1/5)' vs. Reality: 'Savvy (4/5)'",
      "why_matters": "You are intellectualizing a visceral problem. Customers buying castor oil packs are often in pain or anxious about their health. They need a 'Safe Harbor,' not a lecture. Intellectual arguments (Savvy) have lower conversion rates than emotional relief (Sanctuary).",
      "action": "Revise the first bullet point. Shift focus from 'Understanding lipophilic toxins' (Intellect) to 'Finally, a safe space for your body' (Relief). Use words like 'Soothe,' 'Calm,' and 'Sanctuary' before introducing the science."

On Amazon, the Jester is completely absent, replaced by a serious Sage/Caregiver mix. Without the wink, the name 'Thrones' risks sounding like awkward medieval roleplay rather than clever branding.",
      "evidence": "[ARCHETYPES MIX] Strategy: 'Jester (15%)' present vs. Reality: 'Jester (0%)' missing",
      "why_matters": "The Jester is your defense mechanism against the embarrassment of the condition (digestive issues). By removing the humor, you make the product feel 'medical' and 'embarrassing' rather than 'human' and 'liberating.'",
      "action": "Reintroduce the 'Wink' in the A+ Content. Add a small graphic or headline that playfully acknowledges the 'Throne' (toilet) connection—e.g., 'Rule your Throne with confidence'—to break the sterile clinical tension."

PDP promises 'The Healer' (4/5)—supportive care. You are one step away from sounding like a gentle moisturizer rather than a potent medical tool.",
      "evidence": "[FUNCTIONAL BENEFITS] Alignment: 90% | Drift: Action Vector (5/5 Fixer vs 4/5 Healer)",
      "why_matters": "People pay premiums for 'Fixes,' not 'Support.' If the language softens further to avoid Amazon compliance algorithms, you lose the 'Medical Grade' efficacy claim that justifies the $40 price point. You must fight to keep the language active and aggressive.",
      "action": "Audit the bullet points for passive verbs. Change 'Helps support' to 'Targets' or 'Restores.' Ensure the imagery in the carousel shows 'Before/After' style diagrams of the liver/lymph system to visually reinforce 'The Fix' without triggering compliance bots."

      "evidence": "[SELF-EXPRESSION] Alignment: 100% | Opportunity: Push 'The Purist' from Curated (3/5) to Cult (5/5)",
      "why_matters": "In a crowded market of cheap castor oils, your glass bottle is your shield. By simply 'mentioning' it, you leave room for doubt. by 'weaponizing' it, you make buying plastic feel like an act of self-harm. You can own the 'Plastic-Free' moral high ground entirely.",
      "action": "Create a 'Glass vs. Plastic' comparison chart in the A+ Content. Use stark visual cues (e.g., red X on plastic, green check on amber glass) and explicit text: 'Plastic leaches. Glass protects.' Turn the packaging choice into a moral imperative."
