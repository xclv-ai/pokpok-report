On Amazon, this narrative is wiped clean, replaced by a faceless 'Lab Breakthrough' (2/5). You have removed the Protagonist from her own story, turning a cult brand into a generic commodity.",
      "evidence": "[NARRATIVE] Strategy: 'The Personal Cure (Survivor 5/5)' vs. Reality: 'The Lab Breakthrough (Professional 2/5)'",
      "why_matters": "People don't pay $37 for castor oil; they pay $37 for Dr. Marisol's secret. By hiding the founder's struggle and triumph, you lose the emotional hook that justifies the 300% price premium over generic oil.",

      "evidence": "[PERSONALITY] Strategy: 'Affectionate (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Distant (2/5)'",
      "why_matters": "A 'Distant' personality struggles to build loyalty. If the customer feels lectured ('If it doesn't test well, we don't bottle it. Period.'), they may buy once out of fear but won't fall in love. Warmth drives retention; sternness only drives transaction.",

      "evidence": "[TONE OF VOICE] Strategy: 'Cheeky (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Grave (1/5)'",
      "why_matters": "When you remove the humor, you lose the brand's soul. The juxtaposition of 'Royalty' and 'Poop' is your magic sauce. By playing it straight on Amazon, you look like a boring medical company with a weird name, rather than a witty wellness revolution.",

      "evidence": "[ARCHETYPES MIX] Alignment: 90% | Drift: Tertiary Magician (15%) replaced by Caregiver (15%)",
      "why_matters": "Safety is the table stakes; Magic is the premium. If you lean entirely into 'Caregiver' (protection from toxins), you become a commodity safety brand. You need the 'Magician' (ancient ritual) to maintain the mystique that commands a luxury price point.",
      "action": "Add a 'Ritual' module to the A+ content. Show the oil being used in a dimly lit, spa-like setting (Magician codes) rather than just bright clinical shots. Use words like 'Alchemy,' 'Ancient,' and 'Golden' to restore the magical undertone."
