      "headline": "Premium Staple vs. Cheap Bulk",
      "description": "Your Strategy positions the product as 'The Gentle Giant'—a premium, masstige staple ($30 value perception) that elevates the bathroom counter. On Amazon, the aggressive pricing ($19.47 for 500ml) and utility focus reframe it as 'The Medical Authority'—a bulk commodity. You are training customers to buy you for volume, not prestige.",
      "evidence": "[POSITIONING] Strategy: 'The Gentle Giant' (Masstige 3/5) vs. Reality: 'The Medical Authority' (Bulk Utility 1/5)",
      "why_matters": "When a brand slides from 'Masstige' to 'Bulk Utility,' it loses pricing power forever. You are currently priced like a high-end ingredient on your site, but like a Costco refill on Amazon. This gap invites competitors to undercut you, as you are competing on volume rather than brand desirability.",
      "action": "Reframe the value proposition in the A+ Content. Instead of focusing on '16.9oz size,' focus on '6-Month Supply of Royal Care.' Use imagery that compares the bottle to luxury cosmetics, not just generic medical supplies."

      "description": "Your narrative strategy is rooted in 'The Green Lab,' where the authority comes from the Harvest and Mother Nature (Setting 4/5). The PDP narrative shifts to 'The Personal Cure,' set in a clinical/technical context (Setting 2/5). You have scrubbed the 'Ancient Secret' romance to sell 'Naturopathic Tech.'",
      "evidence": "[NARRATIVE] Strategy: 'Harvest' (4/5) vs. Reality: 'Tech-Forward/Clinical' (2/5)",
      "why_matters": "Clinical brands are replaceable by better specs; Nature brands are irreplaceable because of their 'Source.' By removing the romance of the harvest, you become just another bottle of oil rather than a potion from the earth.",

      "evidence": "[PERSONALITY] Strategy: 'The Trusted Friend' (Affectionate 4/5) vs. Reality: 'The Reliable Expert' (Pleasant 3/5)",
      "why_matters": "Trust is built on warmth, not just competence. If you lose the affectionate 'Queen' persona, the brand becomes cold and corporate. Customers stay for the relationship, not just the results.",
      "action": "Warm up the bullet points. Change 'Designed by a naturopathic doctor' to 'Lovingly designed by Dr. Marisol.' Add emotive language like 'Love your liver' or 'Hug your thyroid' back into the copy to bridge the warmth gap."

Strategy holds 'The Magician' (15% - Ancient Secret), while Reality shifts to 'The Sage' (20% - Education). You are slowly trading mystery for textbooks. A brand without mystery becomes a textbook—useful, but boring.",
      "evidence": "[ARCHETYPES] Strategy: Magician (15%) vs. Reality: Sage (20%) | Loss of 'Ancient Secret' allure.",
      "why_matters": "The 'Magician' archetype allows for premium pricing because it promises transformation. 'The Sage' only promises information. If you drift too far into education, you lose the emotional hook of the 'Ancient Beauty Secret.'",
