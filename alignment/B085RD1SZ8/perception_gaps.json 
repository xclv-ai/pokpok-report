On Amazon, you have sanitized this into 'The Clinical Authority'—dry, traditional, and serious. You have stripped away the very personality that makes a laxative oil 'cool,' leaving behind a generic medical product.",

      "why_matters": "In a commodity market, personality is the only moat. By removing the humor and 'Queen' energy, you become indistinguishable from cheaper generic options. You are trading a cult following for clinical respectability that you don't need.",

On Amazon, she is relegated to a background footnote, replaced by a 'Sterile' setting (1/5) focused on the bottle and the lab. The user is buying a person's expertise, but you are selling them an inanimate object.",
      "evidence": "[NARRATIVE] Strategy: 'The Personal Cure (Visionary)' vs. Reality: 'The Green Lab (Sterile)'",
      "why_matters": "Trust in the wellness category is transferred from person to person. Removing the Founder from the primary narrative weakens the 'Practitioner Grade' claim, making it feel like a corporate marketing term rather than a personal guarantee.",
