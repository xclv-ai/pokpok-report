On Amazon, you have replaced both with 'The Sage' (60%). You are no longer the cheeky Queen ruling the throne; you are a dry professor lecturing about lipids. You deleted the brand's soul.",

      "why_matters": "The 'Queen' and 'Poo' angles are what separate you from generic castor oil. By suppressing the Jester, you lose the relatability that makes a gross topic (constipation) approachable. Without the Ruler's swagger, the $37 price point feels unjustified.",

      "evidence": "[MESSAGING] Strategy: 'The Result (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'The Feature (3/5)'",
      "why_matters": "When you lead with 'Hexane-Free,' you are fighting a commodity war. When you lead with 'Deep Sleep,' you are selling a life upgrade. The current Amazon messaging reduces the product to its ingredients, eroding your premium positioning.",
