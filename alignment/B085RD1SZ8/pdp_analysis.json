    "description": "Queen of the Thrones positions itself as the 'Practitioner Grade' authority in a sea of commodity oils. By attacking the industry standard of plastic bottling with a 'Glass vs. Toxins' fear narrative, it elevates a simple ingredient into a medical-grade ritual. It feels like a high-end naturopathic prescription—expensive, authoritative, and obsessively pure."

      "title": "The Safety Sovereign",
      "description": "The brand anchors its Purpose in 'Practitioner Grade' Bio-Active power, validating ancient wisdom with clinical language. It adopts a Safety First value system, ruthlessly prioritizing purity (Glass over Plastic) to justify an Aspirational price point ($37 vs $15). The strategy is The Scientific Miracle—selling the 'cleanest' version of nature at a premium."

      "title": "The Benevolent Ruler",
      "description": "Driven by The Ruler archetype (Primary), the brand projects absolute control over quality ('If it doesn't test well, we don't bottle it'). The visual identity is Earthy Organic but structured with 'Clinical Gold' cues. The tone is a Gentle Guide, blending 'Queen' authority with supportive 'self-care' encouragement."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Toxic-Free Education",
      "description": "The messaging acts as The Problem Solver, identifying an invisible enemy (Plastic/Hexane) and offering the only safe solution (Amber Glass). The Narrative is The Green Lab, emphasizing the Naturopathic Doctor origin. It focuses on Education over inspiration, teaching users about 'lipophilic' absorption to build trust."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Purist Protection",
      "description": "Functionally, it offers Hydration, but the true sell is Protection—shielding the body from modern toxins. The Emotional Benefit is Intelligence (validation of making the 'safer' choice). Socially, it creates a Knowledge Club for 'Wellness Practitioners' and those smart enough to avoid plastic."
