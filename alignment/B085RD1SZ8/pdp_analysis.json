    "headline": "The Holistic Sovereign",
    "description": "Queen of the Thrones positions itself as the regal authority in natural wellness, elevating a commodity ingredient (Castor Oil) into a 'Practitioner Grade' ritual. By combining clinical validation ('Naturopathic Doctor created') with spiritual wellness language ('Energetic flow'), it bridges the gap between the medical clinic and the yoga studio. It feels like a protected sanctuary—safe, pure, and glass-bottled—offering an escape from the 'toxic' plastic world."

      "description": "The brand acts as a Harmonizer, anchoring its authority in the purity of the source (Organic, Hexane-Free) to restore natural balance.

The USP is The Ingredient King, claiming absolute sovereignty over Castor Oil. The narrative is a Green Lab story—'Created by a Naturopathic Doctor' but sourced from the earth, focusing on Education to justify the ritual."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Ritualistic Relief",
