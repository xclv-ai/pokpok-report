    "description": "Queen of the Thrones positions itself as the regal authority in the holistic wellness space, elevating a commodity ingredient (castor oil) into a 'Practitioner Grade' ritual. By combining the archetype of The Ruler ('Queen', 'Crown') with the credibility of The Sage ('Naturopathic Doctor designed'), it successfully convinces the user that packaging (Amber Glass) is a matter of health, not just aesthetics. It feels like an exclusive professional treatment made accessible for the home sanctuary."

      "title": "The Purity Protocol",
      "description": "The messaging Hook targets 'The Component' (Glass vs. Plastic) as the primary differentiator, turning the container itself into a USP. The narrative is a Personal Cure story rooted in professional naturopathic wisdom. The Focus is deeply Educational, teaching the user about 'lipophilic toxins' to justify the premium price point."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Ritualistic Detox",
