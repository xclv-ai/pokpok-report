    "description": "Queen of the Thrones elevates a humble commodity (castor oil) into a royal wellness ritual through the lens of 'Practitioner Grade' purity. By leveraging the authority of a Naturopathic Doctor and the fear of 'plastic toxins,' it justifies a premium price point, positioning the product not just as a beauty oil, but as a medical-grade tool for systemic health (liver, thyroid, energetic flow). It feels like an apothecary prescription for the modern wellness warrior."

The payoff is deep Restoration, moving beyond skin deep to 'energetic flow' and organ health."
