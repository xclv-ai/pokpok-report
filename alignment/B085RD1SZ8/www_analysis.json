    "description": "Queen of the Thrones successfully rebrands a messy, ancient folk remedy into a polished, aspirational wellness ritual. By combining the authority of a Naturopathic Doctor (The Sage) with the playful grandeur of royalty (The Ruler), the brand elevates a commodity oil into a 'Golden Standard' system for modern detox.

      "title": "The Golden Healer",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in 'Ancient Wisdom' refined by 'Modern Science,' positioning itself as a Harmonizer that restores biological order.

      "title": "Educational Sovereignty",
      "description": "The messaging leads with The Problem Solver logic—targeting specific pains like bloating and sleep issues—but wraps it in a narrative of The Personal Cure (Dr. Marisol's story). The focus is heavily Educational, teaching the 'Why' and 'How' of the castor oil pack ritual to overcome the skepticism of messiness."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Biological Sanctuary",
      "description": "Functionally, it offers Restoration of the body's core systems (liver, lymph). Emotionally, it sells Relief and Sanctuary—a safe, quiet ritual in a noisy world. Socially, it acts as a badge for The Knowledge Club, signaling membership in a tribe that understands the deep secrets of natural health."
