    "description": "Queen of the Thrones reframes a grandmother's remedy (castor oil) into a modern empowerment ritual. By combining the clinical authority of 'USDA Organic' with the cheeky, high-energy branding of 'The Queen,' it positions a functional detox product as a lifestyle essential. It feels like a trusted naturopathic prescription wrapped in a hot pink party dress."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Certified Harmonizer",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the purity of nature (USDA Organic, Cold-Pressed) to serve a mission of Restoration—specifically 'Toxin Removal.' It adopts a Formula Purity value system, sacrificing convenience for chemical-free safety (Hexane-free). The positioning is Masstige, elevating a commodity oil into a premium 'Golden' standard accessible to the wellness-curious."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Benevolent Ruler",
      "description": "The identity is dominated by The Ruler (60%), projecting control and quality through 'Queen' branding and gold accents, supported by The Caregiver's focus on healing. Visually, it's a hybrid: an Earthy Organic base disrupted by Gen-Z Pop neon pinks. The tone is The Hype Beast—enthusiastic, loud, and directive ('Do the Cleanse!')."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Ritualistic Problem Solving",
      "description": "The messaging acts as The Problem Solver, targeting specific biological needs ('Toxin removal', 'Nails') rather than vague beauty claims. The narrative is built around The Ritual—specifically the '7-Day Energy Cleanse'—turning a product application into a health practice. The focus balances Education ('How to') with Commerce."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Purity",
      "description": "Functionally, it acts as a Restorer, fixing the body's toxic burden and dry skin. The emotional payoff is Relief—the removal of 'mess' and anxiety about purity. Socially, it acts as The Knowledge Club, signaling membership in an educated tribe that understands the niche value of castor oil packs."
