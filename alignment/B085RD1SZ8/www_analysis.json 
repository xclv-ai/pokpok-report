    "description": "Queen of the Thrones takes a messy, unglamorous bio-hack (castor oil for constipation and liver detox) and rebrands it as a royal ritual. By using humor ('The Throne' = the toilet) and high-polish aesthetics (gold, crowns), it elevates a 'gross' bodily function into a self-care luxury. It bridges the gap between the crunchy naturopathic clinic and the polished Instagram feed."

The Narrative is The Personal Cure, centered on Dr. Marisol's own health struggles. It focuses on Education to explain the mechanism of action, convincing the user that a piece of cloth can change their biology."
