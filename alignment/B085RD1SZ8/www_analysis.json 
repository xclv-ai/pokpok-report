    "headline": "The Royal Alchemist",
    "description": "Queen of the Thrones takes an unglamorous, messy ancient remedy (castor oil) and elevates it into a 'Royal' self-care ritual. By demonizing plastic (the enemy) and crowning glass (the savior), it positions itself as the only safe option for the 'Crunchy' wellness elite. It bridges the gap between a Naturopathic Clinic (Education) and a Luxury Spa (Identity), turning a liver detox into a status symbol."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Ancient Harmonizer",
      "description": "The brand's authority is rooted entirely in Natural Wisdom—specifically ancient practices validated by a Naturopathic doctor. It positions itself as a Harmonizer, aiming to restore the body's natural balance through 'Practitioner Grade' purity. The strategy is Aspirational Wellness; asking you to pay a premium ($35+) for a commodity ingredient because the 'Vessel' (Glass) guarantees safety."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Benevolent Ruler",
      "description": "The 'Queen' archetype dominates (60%), offering order and status in the chaotic world of toxins, supported by The Sage (25%) who provides the medical context. The Visual Identity is Earthy Organic but polished with gold and amber to signal royalty. The tone is an Empowering Guide—authoritative yet deeply nurturing, using the language of self-love to sell detoxification."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Purity Protocol",
      "description": "The messaging Hook is the 'Glass Bottle'—defining the enemy as plastic leaching rather than just selling the oil itself. The Narrative centers on Dr. Marisol (The Survivor/Professional) who turned her pain into a movement. The Focus is heavily Educational, teaching the 'Why' and 'How' of the ritual to justify the premium price."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Ritualistic Restoration",
      "description": "Functionally, this is about Restoration—fixing digestion, liver stagnation, and skin health. Emotionally, it sells Relief (safety from toxins) wrapped in Status (I treat my body like a temple). Socially, it offers membership into The Knowledge Club—the tribe of people who know that 'plastic is poison' and are willing to pay to avoid it."
