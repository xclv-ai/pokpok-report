    "description": "Queen of the Thrones takes a messy, unglamorous commodity (castor oil) and elevates it into a royal wellness ritual. By combining the authority of a 'Doctor' founder with the cheeky approachability of 'Toilet Talk,' they destigmatize gut health. It feels like a high-end spa treatment for your internal organs, positioning a simple oil as the golden key to biological sovereignty."

      "title": "The Benevolent Sovereign",
      "description": "The brand stands as a Harmonizer, claiming authority from 'Ancient Wisdom' rather than the pharmaceutical lab. It balances this with a rigid 'Safety First' value system, obsessing over purity (Glass vs. Plastic) to guarantee the product is worthy of the body's temple. The strategy is to turn a utility product into a Clean Essentialist status symbol."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Cheeky Monarch",
      "description": "The distance is managed carefully—Dr. Marisol is the 'Queen,' but she invites you into the castle as a peer. The Archetype mix is dominated by The Ruler (Gold, Thrones, Crowns) but softened by The Caregiver's desire to heal. The tone is a Hype Beast of wellness—enthusiastic, capitalized, and unafraid to talk about poop."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Purity Propaganda",
      "description": "The messaging is built on a specific villain: Plastic. The Hook is the 'Glass Bottle,' arguing that other oils are poisoned by their containers. The Narrative is a Personal Cure, driven by a naturopathic doctor who healed herself. It focuses heavily on Education, teaching the user *why* they need this specific grade of oil."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Biological Sanctuary",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Restorer, aimed at fixing stagnation (liver, lymph, gut). Emotionally, it offers Safety—the relief of knowing you aren't poisoning yourself with toxins. Socially, it creates a Knowledge Club, signaling that the user is an 'insider' who understands the dangers of plastic and the secrets of lymphatic health."
