    "description": "La Roche-Posay acts as the supreme medical authority in the bathroom. It strips away all vanity and romance to focus entirely on biological restoration and safety. By validating its formula on the most fragile skin (babies, chemotherapy patients), it positions itself not as a beauty product, but as a necessary health intervention for a compromised barrier."

Dominated by The Sage archetype (60%), it leads with 'Microbiome Science' and data, supported by The Caregiver (25%) who ensures safety for the vulnerable.

The USP is The Specialist, owning the niche of 'compromised skin' (Eczema, Chemo) rather than general dryness. The focus is Science Education, prioritizing diagrams and studies over lifestyle inspiration to build unshakable trust."

The emotional payoff is Relief/Safety—the absence of pain or worry for those with reactive skin.
