    "description": "La Roche-Posay feels like a prescription you can buy without a doctor. It occupies the 'Medical Authority' slot in the drugstore aisle, trading joy and sensory pleasure for absolute biological safety and repair. It is the brand you turn to when your skin is broken, frightened, or vulnerable (babies, eczema, chemo), serving as a sterile shield against a hostile world."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "Accessible Medical Authority",
      "description": "The brand's authority is rooted entirely in the Clinical Lab, positioning itself as a Healer that fixes pathologies rather than enhancing beauty. By combining this rigorous medical positioning with a 'Democratic' access strategy ($22.99 at Amazon), it acts as a Medical Authority accessible to the masses. The core value is Safety First—sacrificing potency or sensory vibes to guarantee tolerance for the most fragile skin."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Sterile Guardian",
      "description": "The distance between brand and user is professional and guarded; it behaves like a Reliable Expert (Dermatologist) rather than a friend. Dominated by The Caregiver (60%) archetype, it uses Pharma-Code visuals (white, blue, sterile) to signal hygiene and competence. The tone is Clinical Authority—dry, serious, and devoid of humor to maintain trust."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Evidence-Based Repair",
      "description": "The messaging ignores 'glow' to focus entirely on 'Repair' and 'Microbiome' balance, using Rational persuasion. The USP is The Tech Engineer, claiming ownership of the 'Microbiome Science' mechanism. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, citing 'Dermatologist Insight' and clinical studies to educate the user on their own biology."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Biological Safety",
      "description": "Functionally, this is a Restoration engine, fixing the skin's broken barrier through lipid replenishment. The psychological payoff is Relief—the absence of itch, pain, or worry. Socially, it is The Safe Choice, allowing the user to blend in with The Majority who prioritize health and safety over trends."
