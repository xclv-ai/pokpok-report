    "description": "La Roche-Posay acts as the adult in the room of skincare—a serious, white-coat authority that prioritizes safety over aesthetics. It exists to fix broken barriers, offering heavy-duty repair for the most vulnerable skins (babies, eczema, chemo patients). It is the anti-viral brand: no trends, no fluff, just rigorous derm-validated engineering for biological health."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Medical Healer",
      "description": "The brand rejects natural mysticism to position itself as The Healer, deriving authority from 'Dermatologist Insight' and clinical grading. It operates on a Safety First value system, sacrificing sensory lightness for absolute tolerance (safe for chemo/babies). The strategy is The Medical Authority—pharmacy-coded efficacy at a masstige price point."

      "title": "The Sterile Sage",
      "description": "The distance between brand and user is significant; this is The Specialist prescribing a solution, not a friend sharing a tip. Dominated by The Sage (60%), it uses Pharma-Code visuals (charts, sterile white/blue) to signal rigor. The voice is The Clinical Authority—academic, dry, and purely informational."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Dermatological Education",
      "description": "The messaging hooks with The Problem (Eczema/Dryness) and persuades with Rational data ('90% reduction'). The USP is The Tech Engineer, owning the 'Microbiome Science' mechanism. The focus is deeply Educational, turning the PDP into a classroom to explain lipid replenishment rather than just showing pretty skin."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Biological Restoration",
      "description": "Functionally, it acts as a Restorer, physically repairing the skin barrier and microbiome. The payoff is Relief—the removal of anxiety regarding irritation or reactions. Socially, it is The Safe Choice, allowing users to outsource their decision-making to the collective wisdom of the medical community."
