    "headline": "The Clinical Pragmatist",
    "description": "Aquaphor is the ultimate utility player in skincare—boring, sterile, and undeniably effective. It rejects all attempts at 'beauty' or 'lifestyle' marketing to position itself as a medical necessity, relying entirely on the authority of the white coat. It feels like a prescription you can buy without a doctor, serving as the universal 'fix-it' tool for skin trauma."

      "title": "The Medical Authority",
      "description": "The brand is a pure Healer, deriving authority from the clinical lab and dermatologist endorsement. It functions as a Medical Authority in the positioning matrix—a utility product found in pharmacies, not boutiques. The mission is Micro-Correction, existing solely to fix specific pathologies (chapped, cracked, dry) with no velvet rope access."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Sterile Caregiver",
      "description": "The identity is defined by The Caregiver (80%) archetype, expressed through a Pharma-Code visual identity of sterile white and medical blue. The personality is The Reliable Expert—distant, competent, and completely devoid of humor. It speaks with a Clinical Authority tone that prioritizes precision over connection."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Problem-Solving Science",
      "description": "The messaging is that of The Problem Solver, hooking the user with the promise of 'Relief' rather than ingredients or dreams. The USP is The Specialist, owning the 'Healing' claim via a semi-occlusive delivery system. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, where trust is built on formulation stability and dermatologist validation."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Urgent Restoration",
      "description": "Functionally, it offers Restoration, physically repairing the skin barrier. Emotionally, it provides Relief, removing the anxiety of pain or discomfort. It appeals to The Pragmatist who buys tools, not toys, and socially represents The Safe Choice—the default standard for anyone who prioritizes efficacy."
