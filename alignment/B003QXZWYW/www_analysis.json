    "headline": "The Clinical Guardian",
    "description": "Aquaphor is the ultimate pragmatist's tool for skin survival. It strips away all vanity and romance to focus entirely on the medical reality of 'healing' and 'protection.' It feels like a doctor's prescription that you can buy without a script—sterile, reliable, and obsessed with efficacy over aesthetics."

      "title": "The Medical Authority",
      "description": "The brand's authority is rooted firmly in the clinic, not the garden, functioning as a Healer that treats skin issues as pathologies to be fixed. By adopting a Medical Authority positioning, it prioritizes safety and utility over beauty standards. It promises a return to health (Restoration) through a 'Daily Essential' strategy that values function over form."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Reliable Caregiver",
      "description": "There is a respectful distance here; the brand acts as a Specialist, not a peer. Dominated by The Caregiver archetype (60%), it seeks to protect and repair, supported by The Sage's clinical wisdom. The visual identity is pure Pharma-Code—blue, white, and sterile—while the voice is a Clinical Authority, speaking in dry, factual statements."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Functional Problem Solver",
      "description": "The messaging is a direct 'Problem-Solution' pitch, using rational claims ('Clinically Proven') to sell a functional result. The Narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, citing dermatologists as the heroes. The Focus is heavily Educational, using the 'Skin Protectant' drug classification to build trust rather than inspire desire."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Pragmatic Restoration",
      "description": "Functionally, the product is a Healer, repairing the barrier to restore health. The Emotional payoff is Relief—the cessation of discomfort and the safety of 'Dermatologist Recommended' care. Socially, it is The Safe Choice, allowing the user to blend in with the Majority who value efficacy above all else."
