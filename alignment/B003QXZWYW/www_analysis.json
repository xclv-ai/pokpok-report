    "description": "La Roche-Posay does not sell beauty; it sells biological order. It feels like a prescription without the co-pay, positioning itself as the ultimate Medical Authority in the mass market. By anchoring its identity in 'Microbiome Science' and 'Dermatologist Recommendations,' it offers a safe harbor for the suffering (eczema, sensitivity) rather than a playground for the vain."
