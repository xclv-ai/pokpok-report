    "gap_description": "Your Strategy defines the messaging hook as 'The Feature' (Triple Repair Action), aiming to solve a problem. The PDP, however, hooks on 'The Molecule' (Prebiotic Thermal Water), requiring the user to be a chemist to understand the value. You are trading functional clarity for intellectual density.",
    "evidence": "[MESSAGING] Strategy: 'The Problem Solver (Feature-Led)' vs. Reality: 'The Chemist (Molecule-Led)'",
    "why_matters": "When you lead with ingredients rather than the 'Repair' outcome, you narrow the funnel to only the most educated shoppers. The average parent seeking eczema relief understands 'Triple Repair' instantly; 'Prebiotic Thermal Water' requires a cognitive leap that lowers conversion.",

    "gap_description": "Your Strategy aims for a 'Specialist' power dynamic (4/5)—high authority, but still human. The PDP pushes this to 'The Deity' (5/5)—unquestionable, distant, and faceless. You have crossed the line from 'Reliable Expert' to 'Cold Institution.'",
    "evidence": "[PERSONALITY] Power Dynamic: Strategy 4/5 (Specialist) vs. Reality 5/5 (Deity)",
    "why_matters": "An authority score of 5/5 can feel arrogant and inaccessible. While it builds trust in efficacy, it erodes connection. Users trust doctors, but they don't necessarily like institutions. You risk becoming too cold to love.",

    "gap_description": "Your Strategy positions the emotional benefit as 'Reassurance' (2/5)—a calm promise of safety. The PDP targets 'Panic Mode' (1/5)—focusing on the urgent cessation of pain for chemo patients and babies. You are selling emergency relief rather than sustainable peace of mind.",
    "evidence": "[EMOTIONAL BENEFITS] Anxiety Axis: Strategy 2/5 (Reassurance) vs. Reality 1/5 (Panic Mode)",
    "why_matters": "Panic sells once, but Sanctuary retains. If the brand feels like a frantic emergency room intervention, users may abandon it once the flare-up subsides. Positioning as 'Reassurance' makes the product a daily ritual; positioning as 'Panic Relief' makes it a medicine cabinet occasional.",
    "do_this_now": "Balance the 'Eczema Relief' urgency with 'Daily Maintenance' framing. Add a module focused on 'Preventative Care' to shift the emotional axis from emergency intervention to long-term sanctuary."
