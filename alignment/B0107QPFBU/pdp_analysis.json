    "headline": "The Clinical Stabilizer",
    "description": "Aquaphor acts as the ultimate utility player in the medicine cabinet, stripping away all cosmetic vanity to focus purely on medical-grade restoration. It positions itself not as a beauty product but as a clinical necessity, leveraging heavy dermatological authority to solve urgent skin pathologies like cracks, burns, and compromised barriers. It feels like a reliable prescription you can buy without a doctor, offering the pragmatic safety of a 'Break Glass in Case of Emergency' solution for the whole family."

  "category_summaries": {
    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Medical Democratizer",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority entirely in the Clinical Lab, using '41% Petrolatum' and 'Dermatologist Recommended' to signal medical legitimacy. It balances this clinical power with a Safety First value system, prioritizing 'Hypoallergenic' tolerance over sensory elegance. The strategy is The Medical Authority—parking itself in the pharmacy aisle rather than the beauty counter to offer Democratic access to healing."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Reliable Caregiver",
      "description": "There is a professional distance here; the brand behaves like The Reliable Expert (Doctor) rather than a friend. Dominated by The Caregiver archetype (60%) with strong Sage backing, it projects protection and healing through a Pharma-Code visual identity (White/Blue/Red). The tone is The Clinical Authority—grave, serious, and focused entirely on the facts."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Rational Problem Solver",
      "description": "The messaging leads with The Result ('Healing', 'Relief') rather than ingredients or vibes, targeting specific pain points to act as The Problem Solver. The USP is The Specialist, owning the 'Healing Ointment' format for compromised skin. The focus is Science Education, using 'Drug Facts' panels and clinical claims to build trust through thesis-level proof."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Relief",
      "description": "Functionally, it is The Fixer, aggressively restoring broken skin barriers rather than just moisturizing. The feeling is Relief/Safety—the removal of pain and the assurance of protection. Socially, it represents The Safe Choice, allowing users to join the vast majority who prioritize pragmatic efficacy over status."
