      "title": "The Medical Authority",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority firmly in the Clinical Lab, validated by dermatologists rather than nature. It operates on a Safety First value system, sacrificing sensory elegance for hypoallergenic potency. The strategy is to be The Medical Authority—a Sterile, Daily Essential that provides a pathology cure for the masses."

      "title": "The Reliable Caregiver",
      "description": "The dynamic is Distant but Competent; the brand stands as The Specialist who knows better than you. Dominated by The Caregiver (60%) archetype, it uses Pharma-Code visuals (white, blue, red) to signal absolute sterility. The tone is The Clinical Authority—serious, professional, and dry, building trust through lack of emotion."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Rational Problem-Solver",
      "description": "The messaging uses a Rational persuasion logic to sell The Result (Healing), hooking the user with promises of repair. The USP is The Specialist—targeting specific compromised skin conditions with a 'breathable barrier' technology. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, relying on the 'Nobel' authority of faceless dermatologists."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Relief",
      "description": "Functionally, it acts as The Fixer (Restoration), repairing broken skin barriers rather than just hydrating. The payoff is Emotional Relief—the reassurance that pain and damage will stop. Socially, it represents The Safe Choice, allowing the user to blend into the Majority who prioritize pragmatic health over trends."
