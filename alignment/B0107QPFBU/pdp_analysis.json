    "description": "Aquaphor isn't skincare; it is skin repair. It rejects the entire category of 'beauty' to position itself as a medical necessity—a 'first aid kit in a tube' that sits in the medicine cabinet rather than the vanity. By focusing entirely on 'compromised' skin (cracked, bleeding, burned), it creates a monopoly on Relief, positioning itself as the ultimate utilitarian tool for when the body breaks down."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Medical Democratizer",
      "description": "The brand's authority is rooted purely in the Clinical Lab, with a 'Healing Ointment' designation that separates it from cosmetic lotions. It operates as a Safety First utility, sacrificing sensory elegance (greasy, heavy) for raw medical potency. The strategy is The Medical Authority: a sterile, trusted product priced democratically to be accessible to every household."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Reliable Caregiver",
      "description": "The distance is that of a trusted doctor—professional, competent, and removed. Dominated by The Caregiver archetype (70%), it focuses on protecting the vulnerable, wrapped in a Pharma-Code visual identity of white, navy, and red. The tone is The Clinical Authority: grave, serious, and exclusively focused on the mechanics of healing."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Functional Problem Solver",
      "description": "The messaging is a direct prescription, hooking the user with a specific pathology (Dry, Cracked, Irritated) rather than a dream. The USP is The Specialist—owning the 'Ointment' format as a distinct medical category superior to lotions. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough story, relying on 'Dermatologist Recommended' credentials to prove efficacy."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Relief",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Fixer, creating an occlusive barrier to physically repair minor wounds and burns. The payoff is Emotional Relief—the cessation of pain and anxiety about skin integrity. Socially, it is The Safe Choice, offering the comfort of the herd (#1 Dermatologist Recommended) and the safety of a standardized solution."
