    "description": "Aquaphor is the medical-grade 'duct tape' of skincare—a utilitarian tool designed to fix problems rather than pamper the senses. It feels like a prescription without the co-pay, prioritizing barrier repair and clinical efficacy over aesthetic pleasure or lifestyle signaling. It plays the role of the reliable family doctor, offering a universal, no-nonsense solution for compromised skin."

      "title": "The Medical Authority",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority firmly in the Clinical Lab, using dermatologist recommendations as its primary trust signal. It operates as a Healer, focusing entirely on fixing pathologies (cracks, cuts, burns) rather than enhancing beauty. The strategy is pure Utility—offering professional-grade restoration at a Democratic price point."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Reliable Caregiver",
      "description": "There is a professional distance between brand and user; it behaves like a competent specialist, not a friend. Dominated by The Caregiver archetype (70%), it focuses on protection and healing, supported by Sage-like clinical proof. The Visual Identity is strict Pharma-Code (white, blue, red), and the tone is a Clinical Authority—serious, helpful, and void of humor."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Problem-Solving Science",
      "description": "The messaging is functional, selling the Relief of specific pain points rather than a dream. The USP is the mechanism—a semi-occlusive barrier that 'allows oxygen to flow' while protecting. The Narrative is a Lab Breakthrough story, citing ingredients like Petrolatum and Panthenol to build trust through science education."

Socially, it is The Safe Choice, allowing the user to blend into The Majority who prioritize proven efficacy over trends."
