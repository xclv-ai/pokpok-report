    "description": "Aquaphor doesn't try to be your friend; it tries to be your doctor. It occupies the 'Medical Authority' slot with absolute confidence, relying on the semiotics of the first-aid kit (White/Navy/Red) and the weight of '#1 Dermatologist Recommended' claims. It is a utilitarian powerhouse that sacrifices all sensory elegance for the singular promise of healing compromised skin."

      "title": "The Democratic Healer",
      "description": "The brand exists to Fix problems, not elevate aesthetics. It is The Healer, treating skin issues as pathologies (cuts, burns, cracks) rather than flaws. By pricing this clinical-grade repair at mass-market levels ($10.97), it acts as a Democratizer, making advanced therapy accessible to every household."

      "title": "The Reliable Caregiver",
      "description": "There is zero ambiguity here; the brand plays The Caregiver (60%) backed by The Sage (25%). The visual identity is pure Pharma-Code—sterile, legible, and devoid of clutter. The tone is The Clinical Authority, speaking in the dry, rhythmic cadence of a medical diagnosis to build maximum trust."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Problem-Solving Science",
      "description": "The messaging is that of The Problem Solver, hooking the user with a specific pain point (cracked skin) and offering a mechanical fix (Petrolatum barrier). The USP is The Specialist, owning the 'Healing Ointment' category so completely that the brand name is often used as a synonym for the product type."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Safety",
      "description": "Functionally, this is Restoration logic—creating an ideal environment for the skin to heal itself. Emotionally, it sells Relief and Safety, removing the panic of 'compromised skin.' Socially, it is The Safe Choice, the unquestioned standard that signals responsible self-care."
