    "headline": "The Universal Healer",
    "description": "Aquaphor positions itself as the ultimate clinical utility player—a 'Swiss Army Knife' for skin pathology. By strictly adhering to pharmacy codes (drug facts, sterile white packaging, dermatologist endorsement), it transcends the beauty category to become a medicine cabinet essential. It feels less like a cosmetic choice and more like a medical necessity for 'compromised' skin."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Clinical Guardian",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority purely in the clinic, positioning itself as a Medical Authority rather than a lifestyle brand. It operates on a Safety First value system, prioritizing 'preservative-free' tolerance for open wounds over cosmetic elegance. The strategy is Utility—offering professional-grade healing at a democratic price point."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Reliable Expert",
      "description": "The distance between brand and user is defined by the white coat; it is The Reliable Expert speaking to a patient. Dominated by The Caregiver archetype (60%) but expressed through the lens of The Sage, the visual identity is pure Pharma-Code. The tone is The Clinical Authority—grave, serious, and focused entirely on efficacy and safety."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Evidence-Based Education",
      "description": "The messaging hooks with the Problem (dry, cracked skin) and persuades with Rational data ('Clinically proven', '#1 Recommended'). The USP is The Specialist format—an 'Ointment' (water-free) that creates a barrier, distinct from lotions. The focus is Science Education, using the PDP to teach the mechanism of semi-occlusive healing."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Safety",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Healer, actively repairing the skin barrier rather than just hydrating. The Emotional Benefit is Relief/Safety—the absence of pain and the assurance of tolerance. Socially, it is The Safe Choice, a mass-market standard that signals pragmatic intelligence rather than status."
