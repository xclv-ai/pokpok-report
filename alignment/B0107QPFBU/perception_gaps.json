    "evidence": "WWW: 'Petrolatum (41%)' (Ingredient) vs. PDP: 'Allows for the flow of oxygen' (Mechanism)",
    "why_matters": "This implies a lack of confidence in the core ingredient. By trying to 'tech-wash' the petrolatum on Amazon, you risk looking defensive. A commodity is honest; 'tech' that is just grease feels like a lie.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are caught between owning your simplicity and feigning complexity.

    "evidence": "WWW: 'Sanitation-style stark-white' vs. PDP: 'Checkmarks and structured badges'",
    "why_matters": "Sterility signals safety, but it kills desire. The PDP proves that a 'Professional' look converts better than a 'Sterile' one because it feels designed for a consumer, not a specimen.",
