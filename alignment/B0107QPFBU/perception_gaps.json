    "gap_description": "Your Strategy wins validation through 'Formula Purity' (The List: Fragrance Free/Dye Free), but the PDP wins through 'Derm-Validation' (The Graph: 41% Petrolatum). The website courts the 'Clean Beauty' anxiety, while Amazon doubles down on heavy-duty chemical occlusion. You are selling safety to one group and industrial-strength repair to another.",

    "why_matters": "The 'Clean' shopper landing on Amazon sees '41% Petrolatum' as a warning sign, not a benefit. By deprioritizing the 'Free-From' narrative on the PDP in favor of chemical mechanism, you risk losing the sensitive-skin parent who buys based on what is NOT in the tube.",

    "why_matters": "Doctors don't pitch; they prescribe. When your content sounds like a sales pitch ('One essential solution!'), you lower your status from 'Expert' to 'Vendor.' High-trust brands must maintain the posture of academic detachment.",
