    "description": "Aquaphor bypasses the beauty conversation entirely to occupy the role of the ultimate skin paramedic. It feels like a medical necessity rather than a cosmetic choice, leveraging 'hospital white' aesthetics and 'dermatologist recommended' authority to signal absolute safety. It is the pragmatic 'Fixer' for when normal skincare fails, trading sensory pleasure for biological repair."

The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough story where doctors are the heroes. The focus is purely on Science Education, explaining the mechanism of the 'semi-occlusive' barrier to build trust."
