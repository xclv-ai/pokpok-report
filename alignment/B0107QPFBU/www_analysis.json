      "title": "The Medical Authority",
      "description": "The brand exists to Fix biological damage, not to elevate aesthetics. It operates as a Healer, deriving authority from the Clinical Lab (Petrolatum, Panthenol) rather than nature.

      "title": "The Sterile Caregiver",
      "description": "There is a professional distance here; the brand behaves like a competent doctor, not a friend. Dominated by The Caregiver archetype (backed by The Sage), it uses a Pharma-Code visual identity—stark white, navy, and warning-red—to signal safety. The tone is The Clinical Authority: serious, respectful, and grave."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Problem-Solving Science",
      "description": "The messaging is stripped of romance, focusing entirely on Rational persuasion to solve specific pathologies (cuts, burns, dryness). The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough story, relying on the 'Nobel' authority of dermatologists. The focus is purely on Education and Trust, proving efficacy through clinical claims."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Biological Relief",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Restoration tool, physically repairing the skin barrier. Emotionally, it provides Relief and Safety—the absence of pain or worry. Socially, it is The Safe Choice, allowing the user to blend into The Majority by choosing the standard, risk-free option."
