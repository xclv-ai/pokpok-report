    "headline": "The Clinical Pragmatist",
    "description": "Aquaphor feels like the ultimate utility tool in the medicine cabinet—devoid of vanity, obsessed with function. It acts as the Medical Authority that has left the sterile lab to join you in the messy real world (via the 'on-the-go' stick format). It offers zero-friction relief, positioning itself not as a beauty product, but as essential infrastructure for skin health."

      "title": "The Mobile Healer",
      "description": "The brand is a Healer, deriving authority from clinical pathology rather than nature. By packaging a 'Skin Protectant' in a convenient stick, it acts as The Guardian, sacrificing the ritual of skincare for the efficiency of a shield. It is a Daily Essential that promises Restoration above all else."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Reliable Caregiver",
      "description": "There is a professional distance here—the warmth of a nurse, not a best friend. Dominated by The Caregiver (60%), it uses Pharma-Code visuals (clinical blue/white) to signal absolute safety. The tone is The Modern Minimalist: direct, instruction-heavy, and stripped of any marketing fluff."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Functional Problem Solver",
      "description": "The messaging is purely functional, hooking the user with The Result ('Relief') rather than an ingredient story. The USP is the Delivery System—taking a messy ointment and engineering it into a clean stick. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, relying on 'Dermatologist Recommended' authority to silence skepticism."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Pragmatic Relief",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Shield, creating a semi-occlusive barrier to lock in moisture. The emotional payoff is Relief—the absence of pain or chapping. Socially, it is The Safe Choice, a Pragmatic purchase that signals intelligence through utility rather than status."
