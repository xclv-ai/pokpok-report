      "title": "The Democratic Healer",
      "description": "The brand's authority is strictly Clinical, deriving power from the lab and dermatologist testing rather than nature.

      "title": "The Reliable Sage",
      "description": "There is a professional distance here; the brand speaks as a Sage/Expert, prioritizing truth and data over intimacy.

The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough story, where unnamed experts have engineered a specific complex to reverse signs of aging."

      "title": "Corrective Confidence",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Restorer, working to tighten and firm the skin structure. The emotional payoff is Confidence—the relief of returning to a 'normal' baseline. Socially, it is The Safe Choice, a pragmatic purchase that signals rationality and immunity to expensive beauty marketing."
