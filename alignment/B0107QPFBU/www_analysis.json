      "title": "The Safe Healer",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the white coat, positioning itself as the #1 Dermatologist Recommended choice. It balances this clinical power with a Safety First value system, stripping away fragrances and preservatives to guarantee tolerance. The strategy is pure Medical Authority—a utilitarian staple found in the medicine cabinet, not the vanity."

      "title": "The Stoic Caregiver",
      "description": "The distance between brand and user is professional; it behaves like a doctor, not a friend. Dominated by The Caregiver archetype, it uses a Pharma-Code visual identity (blue, white, sterile) to signal hygiene and trust. The voice is a Clinical Authority—dry, direct, and factual."

      "description": "The messaging leads with the Benefit ('Relieves,' 'Protects') backed by Rational persuasion ('Clinically proven'). The USP is The Specialist—owning the mental slot for 'Healing Ointment' via a unique delivery system (Stick). The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, where faceless expertise creates the ultimate skin shield."
