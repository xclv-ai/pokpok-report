    "description": "Cetaphil acts as the baseline of safety in the skincare world. It deliberately removes all 'noise'—fragrance, trendiness, and aesthetic flourish—to function as a sterile, reliable tool for skin health. It feels less like a beauty product and more like a prescription from a dermatologist, positioning itself as the ultimate safe harbor for sensitive skin."

      "title": "The Clinical Guardian",
      "description": "The brand derives its authority entirely from the 'White Coat' (Dermatologists), positioning itself as a Guardian against skin sensitivity. It values Safety First, sacrificing potency or sensory pleasure to guarantee absolute tolerance for the most fragile skin barriers. It occupies the Medical Authority slot, selling utility and health rather than lifestyle aspiration."

      "title": "The Sterile Caregiver",
      "description": "The distance between brand and user is Professional—it speaks down to the user with the authority of a specialist. The dominant archetype is The Caregiver (60%), driven to protect and restore, expressed through a Pharma-Code visual identity of hospital whites and clinical blues. The tone is The Clinical Authority: dry, serious, and stripped of all humor."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Rational Problem Solving",
      "description": "The messaging uses a Rational hook, persuading through clinical proof ('48 hours', '5 Signs') rather than emotion. The USP is The Specialist, owning the 'Sensitive Skin' diagnosis completely. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough story, where faceless experts and associations (National Eczema Association) validate the product's existence."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Relief",
      "description": "Functionally, the product acts as a Healer, restoring the broken moisture barrier to a baseline of health. The emotional payoff is Relief/Safety—the absence of worry or irritation. Socially, it is The Safe Choice, allowing the user to blend in with The Majority who prioritize pragmatic results over trends."
