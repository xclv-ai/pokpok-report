    "description": "Cetaphil positions itself as the absolute baseline of medical skin safety. It strips away all vanity, luxury, and sensory pleasure to focus entirely on biological restoration and defense.

      "title": "The Medical Healer",
      "description": "The brand's authority is rooted entirely in the Clinical Lab, rejecting natural wisdom for dermatologist validation. It operates as a Healer, dedicated to restoring broken skin barriers rather than enhancing aesthetics. With a 'Safety First' value system and a 'Medical Authority' positioning, it sacrifices shelf appeal for the promise of zero irritation."

      "description": "There is a professional distance here; the brand acts as a Reliable Expert or Doctor, not a friend. The Archetype is the Caregiver (60%) expressed through the Sage's data. Visually, it uses Pharma-Code sterility (white, blue, medical green) to signal hygiene, while the Tone of Voice is strictly Clinical Authority—dry, precise, and devoid of humor."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Problem Solving Science",
      "description": "The messaging ignores 'dreams' to target 'problems' (Dryness, Eczema) using Rational persuasion ('Clinically proven'). The USP is The Specialist, carving out ownership of 'Sensitive Skin' defense. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, framing the product as a tool engineered by experts to fix specific pathologies."

      "title": "Biological Restoration",

Socially, it represents The Safe Choice, allowing the user to blend in with The Majority by choosing the 'gold standard' of basic care."
