    "description": "Cetaphil acts as the stoic, reliable doctor in the skincare aisle.

      "title": "The Safe Authority",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the clinic, not the garden, functioning as a Healer that treats dryness as a pathology to be fixed. Its Safety First values dictate a 'Do No Harm' approach, prioritizing tolerance over aggression. Strategically, it occupies The Medical Authority slot—a utilitarian essential that looks and acts like medicine."

      "title": "The Stoic Specialist",
      "description": "There is a distinct professional distance here; the brand is a Caregiver, but one wearing a white coat. The visual identity is pure Pharma-Code—sterile whites and clinical blues that signal absolute hygiene. The voice is that of a Reliable Expert: dry, academic, and devoid of humor, speaking only in facts and claims."

      "title": "Functional Problem Solver",
      "description": "The messaging ignores 'dreams' to focus entirely on the Problem (dryness) and the Solution (restoration). The USP is The Specialist, owning the 'Sensitive Skin' niche through the '5 Signs' diagnosis. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough story, relying on 'Dermatologist Recommended' and 'Clinically Proven' stamps to build trust through education."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Relief",
      "description": "Functionally, it offers Restoration, fixing the broken moisture barrier rather than just masking it. The emotional payoff is Relief—the absence of worry or irritation. Socially, it represents The Safe Choice, allowing the user to blend into the 'Smart Pragmatist' majority who value efficacy over hype."
