    "gap_description": "While your Strategy aims for a 'Serious' and 'Professional' tone (competent but modern), the PDP drifts into 'Grave' and 'Traditional' territory. The language on Amazon feels less like a dermatologist's advice and more like a warning label. You have crossed the line from 'Clinical Authority' to 'Joyless Utility'.",
    "evidence": "[TONE] Strategy: 'Serious (2/5) / Professional (3/5)' vs. Reality: 'Grave (1/5) / Traditional (2/5)'",
    "why_matters": "A 'Grave' tone creates emotional distance. While safety is key, sounding archaic or overly solemn can alienate younger consumers who expect medical authority to be delivered with modern professionalism, not old-school rigidity.",

    "gap_description": "Your Strategy balances 'The Caregiver' with a touch of 'The Everyman' (10%) to maintain accessibility. On the PDP, 'The Everyman' is replaced by 'The Ruler' (10%), signaled by aggressive 'Defends' and 'Backed by' language. You are trading 'neighborly safety' for 'authoritarian command'.",
    "evidence": "[ARCHETYPES] Strategy: 'The Everyman (Connection)' vs. Reality: 'The Ruler (Control)'",
    "why_matters": "Cetaphil's superpower is its democratic nature—it is for everyone. Replacing the 'Everyman' trait with 'The Ruler' risks making the brand feel superior rather than accessible, potentially opening the door for a 'friendlier' competitor like CeraVe to claim the relatability ground.",

    "gap_description": "Your Strategy identifies the user's emotional state as 'Panic' (1/5)—the urgent need to stop irritation. The PDP jumps straight to 'Reassurance' (2/5). You are offering the solution ('Comforts') without fully acknowledging the problem ('Stinging/Tightness'). You are skipping the empathy step.",
    "evidence": "[EMOTIONAL BENEFITS] Strategy: 'Panic Mode (1/5)' vs. Reality: 'Reassurance (2/5)'",
    "why_matters": "Conversion happens when the customer feels understood. By skipping the acknowledgment of 'Panic' (the visceral pain of sensitive skin), you reduce the urgency of the purchase. Acknowledge the sting before you promise the soothe.",

    "evidence": "[MISSION] Alignment: 90% | Risk: Scope slider drifting from 'Micro-Correction (1)' to 'Optimization (2)'",
    "why_matters": "If you lose the 'Correction' framing, you lose pricing power. 'Fixing a broken barrier' is a medical necessity; 'Moisturizing dry skin' is a commodity. Protect the 'Healer' positioning at all costs.",
