    "why_matters": "The website feels like a dermatologist's waiting room (calm). The Amazon page feels like the operating theater (sterile). The drop in temperature on Amazon removes the 'Care' from 'Caregiver', leaving only the science.",

    "the_hard_choice": "You have successfully eliminated all emotion from the brand to prove your science. But humans buy on emotion. You face a critical adjustment: either maintain this 'Robotic' stance to be the undisputed king of efficacy (Option A), or dial the thermostat up to 'Empathetic' to defend against brands that are actually nice to their customers (Option B).
