    "description": "Cetaphil positions itself as the ultimate safety net for skin health, stripping away vanity to focus entirely on biological restoration.

      "title": "The Democratic Healer",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the clinic, not the garden, functioning as a Healer that treats sensitivity as a condition to be managed rather than a flaw to be hidden. It upholds a strict Safety First value system, sacrificing potency for absolute tolerance. The strategy is pure Medical Authority—offering pharmaceutical-grade barrier repair at a commodity price point."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Sterile Caregiver",
      "description": "There is a significant professional distance between brand and user; it behaves like a competent specialist rather than a friend. Dominated by The Caregiver archetype (60%) but tempered by The Sage, it uses Pharma-Code visuals to signal rigor and cleanliness. The voice is a Clinical Authority—dry, precise, and purely informational."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Evidence-Based Problem Solving",
      "description": "The messaging targets the biological problem ('Weakened Barrier') rather than the aesthetic result, using Rational persuasion to build a case for efficacy. The USP is The Specialist for sensitive skin, owning the '5 Signs of Sensitivity' framework. The narrative creates a Lab Breakthrough origin story, where trust is derived from 'Galderma data' and clinical trials."

      "title": "Restorative Safety",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Restoration engine, physically repairing the lipid barrier to defend against dryness. The emotional payoff is Relief—the absence of worry about reactions or irritation. Socially, it represents The Safe Choice, allowing the user to blend into the 'Smart Majority' who prioritize health over hype."
