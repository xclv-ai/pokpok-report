    "description": "Cetaphil is the white coat in a bathroom full of beauty products. It rejects 'pampering' in favor of 'prescription-grade' reliability, positioning itself as the ultimate safe harbor for sensitive skin. It plays the role of the stoic dermatologist who doesn't care about trends, only about biological restoration."

      "title": "The Medical Authority",
      "description": "The brand derives its power entirely from the Lab, using 'Dermatologist Backed' and 'Clinically Proven' as its unshakeable foundation. It adopts a Safety First value system, sacrificing potency claims to guarantee 'Hypoallergenic' tolerance. The strategy is pure Medical Authority—parking itself in the pharmacy aisle of the customer's mind, distinct from the beauty aisle."

      "title": "The Reliable Caregiver",
      "description": "There is a significant professional distance here; the brand acts as a Reliable Expert rather than a friend. Dominated by The Caregiver (60%) and The Sage (30%), it projects a protective, knowledgeable persona. The visual code is Pharma-Code sterility (white/green/blue) matched with a Clinical Authority tone that speaks in diagnoses ('Defends against 5 signs')."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Evidence-Based Problem Solver",
      "description": "The messaging is a diagnostic checklist, targeting 'Roughness' and 'Weakened Barrier' rather than aesthetic beauty. The USP is The Specialist—owning the 'Sensitive Skin' diagnosis globally. The narrative creates a Lab Breakthrough origin story, where faceless experts at Galderma engineer solutions, prioritizing Education over inspiration."

      "title": "Biological Restoration",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Healer, focused on physically repairing the moisture barrier. The emotional payoff is Relief—the absence of irritation and the return to a safe baseline. Socially, it represents The Safe Choice, offering the comfort of the herd (34k+ reviews) and the immunity of making the 'sensible' decision."
