    "description": "Cetaphil positions itself as the ultimate safe harbor for sensitive skin, stripping away all marketing fluff to focus entirely on dermatological authority. It functions as a medical utility rather than a beauty product, selling the absence of irritation (Relief) rather than the presence of glamour. It plays the role of the boring but essential doctor in the customer's life—unexciting, reliable, and absolutely necessary."

      "description": "The brand's authority is strictly Clinical, deriving power from 'Galderma data' and white-coat endorsement rather than nature. It balances this with a 'Safety First' value system, sacrificing potency for absolute tolerance. The strategy is pure Medical Authority available at a Democratic price point—making professional-grade skin defense accessible to the masses."

The tone is a Clinical Authority—serious, dry, and void of humor, ensuring the user feels diagnosed rather than entertained."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Dermatological Logic",
      "description": "The messaging uses a Problem Solver hook, selling the specific relief of '5 Signs of Sensitivity' through Rational persuasion. The USP is The Specialist—owning the 'Sensitive Skin' niche completely. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, citing 'Galderma data' to build trust through education rather than inspiration."
