    "description": "Cetaphil positions itself as the absolute baseline of medical safety in skincare. It is the 'white coat' in a jar—stripping away all vanity, scent, and trendiness to focus purely on biological defense and barrier restoration. It feels less like a beauty product and more like a prescription you can buy at the drugstore, playing the role of the vigilant protector for sensitive skin."

      "description": "The brand's authority is strictly Clinical, acting as The Healer for compromised skin barriers.

The strategy is The Democratizer—offering professional-grade dermatological care at a commodity price point ($19.48 for bulk)."

      "title": "The Sterile Caregiver",
      "description": "The psychological distance is that of a Reliable Expert—warm enough to care, but cool enough to be objective. Dominated by The Caregiver archetype (65%), it expresses this protection through a Pharma-Code visual identity (white, green, blue). The tone is The Clinical Authority: dry, precise, and reassuringly boring."

      "title": "Evidence-Based Problem Solving",
      "description": "The messaging is that of The Problem Solver, hooking the user with specific relief ('Defends against 5 signs') rather than dreams. The USP is The Specialist, owning the 'Sensitive Skin' niche completely. Trust is built via Derm-Validation, using doctor endorsements as the primary currency over social hype."

Socially, it is The Safe Choice and The Pragmatist, signaling that the user prioritizes health and logic over trends."
