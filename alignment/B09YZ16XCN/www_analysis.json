      "title": "The Medical Healer",
      "description": "The brand's authority is rooted firmly in the lab, treating aging skin as a condition to be managed rather than a journey to be celebrated.

It is The Medical Authority, promising restoration through science."

      "title": "The Reliable Sage",
      "description": "The distance between brand and user is professional and respectful; it behaves like a dermatologist, not a friend. Dominated by The Sage (60%) and Caregiver (25%) archetypes, it uses a Pharma-Code visual identity (gold, blue, white) to signal absolute safety. The voice is Clinical Authority—dry, precise, and purely informational."

      "title": "Functional Problem Solving",
      "description": "The messaging leads with the Problem ('Crepe Skin') and solves it with Rational Data ('Clinically shown'). The USP is The Specialist, owning the specific niche of 'Crepe Correction' in the mass market. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough story, using clinical studies as the primary trust anchor to educate rather than inspire."
