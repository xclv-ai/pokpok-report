    "description": "Gold Bond sheds its dusty 'medicated powder' heritage to occupy the 'High-Performance Drugstore' slot. It speaks the language of the clinic (Correct, Renew, Dermatologist-tested) but sells the dream of the spa (Botanicals, Omega-fatty acids). It is the pragmatic choice for the aging consumer who wants 'Product of the Year' results without the Sephora price tag."

It adopts a Safety First value system ('Hypoallergenic', 'Dermatologist tested') while acting as a Medical Authority in the Masstige pricing tier. The payoff is clinical restoration accessible at Walmart."

Dominated by The Sage (70%), it relies on data and ingredients to build trust, wrapped in a Pharma-Code visual identity (White/Gold/Purple). The voice is The Clinical Authority—serious, instructional, and void of humor."

      "title": "The Problem Solver",
      "description": "The hook is pure functional utility: 'Crepe Corrector.' It identifies a specific aging anxiety and promises a solution. The USP is The Specialist, owning the 'Crepe' niche within the broader lotion category. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, where specific ingredient complexes (7+3) solve what nature broke."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Corrective Confidence",
      "description": "Functionally, it promises Correction—visibly changing the texture of aging skin. The emotional payoff is Confidence (restoring normality), while socially it represents The Safe Choice—a rational, highly-rated product that signals intelligence rather than status."
