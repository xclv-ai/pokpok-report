    "description": "Gold Bond sheds its heritage as a commodity brand to position this product as a high-performance medical intervention for aging skin. By claiming the specific territory of 'Crepe Correction' with hard clinical statistics ('82% improvement in 2 days'), it acts as an affordable dermatologist in the drugstore aisle. It feels serious, potent, and ruthlessly focused on fixing a specific problem rather than offering a sensory experience."
