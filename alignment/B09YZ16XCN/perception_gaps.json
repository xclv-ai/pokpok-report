On Amazon, you shift to 'The Ruler' (40%), using authority markers like 'Product of the Year' and 'Gold Bond' heritage to command compliance. You are trading connection for dominance.",
    "evidence": "[ARCHETYPES] Strategy: 'Caregiver (50%)' vs. Reality: 'Ruler (40%)'",
    "why_matters": "A 'Caregiver' brand earns loyalty through trust; a 'Ruler' brand demands it through status. When you switch modes, you confuse the customer relationship.

    "evidence": "[VALUES] Strategy: 'Safety First (Gentle 2/5)' vs. Reality: 'Clinical Efficacy (Performance 4/5)'",
    "why_matters": "This creates a dangerous expectation gap. Customers buying for 'Gentle' safety (Strategy) may perceive the active 'Correction' focus on Amazon as harsh.

    "evidence": "[KEY SELLING POINTS] Strategy: 'Derm-Validation (The Lab)' vs. Reality: 'Viral Results (The Users)'",
    "why_matters": "When a medical brand relies too much on user ratings, it becomes a commodity 'people's choice' rather than a 'doctor's prescription.' You lose the pricing power of the expert. If you are just 'popular,' a cheaper popular option can replace you.",
    "do_this_now": "Re-assert the White Coat in the image gallery. Move the 'Dermatologist Tested' claim from a badge to a primary feature image that explains *why* doctors choose it (e.g., 'The Science of Crepe Correction'). Don't let the star rating do all the work."

    "why_matters": "The 'Peach' tone is your only visual defense against looking like a hospital product. On a white Amazon background, your white bottle with gold text has no 'container' to hold the brand vibe. Without the warmth, you lose the 'Beauty' cue and become purely 'Medicine.'",
