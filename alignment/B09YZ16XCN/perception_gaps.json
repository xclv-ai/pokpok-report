    "gap_description": "On your website, you are a warm, inviting medical professional (Earthy Organic)—using peach tones to say 'I understand skin.' On Amazon, you stripped the paint off the walls (Pharma-Code). The visual temperature dropped from 'Radiating' (4/5) to 'Cool' (2/5). You traded empathy for sterility.",
    "evidence": "[VISUAL IDENTITY] Strategy: 'Earthy Organic (Harmony)' vs. Reality: 'Pharma-Code (Sterility)'",

The PDP fires the Caregiver and hires 'The Ruler' (20%) instead, flashing badges and awards. You stopped hugging the patient and started flashing your credentials.",

You are promising speed ('in just 2 days') so aggressively that the safety message is getting drowned out by the engine noise.",
    "evidence": "[VALUES] Strategy: 'Balanced (3/5)' vs. Reality: 'High-Performance (4/5)'",
    "why_matters": "For an anti-aging product, efficacy is key. But for a 'Crepe Corrector' (often for older, thinner skin), safety is the barrier to entry. If you look too potent, the customer fears irritation. You are trading long-term trust for short-term conversion.",

    "evidence": "[TONE OF VOICE] Alignment: 95% | Risk: Formality slider drift (2/5 -> 3/5)",
    "why_matters": "When a brand becomes too formal, it stops feeling like a consumer good and starts feeling like a prescription. You lose the emotional connection that drives repeat purchase. Nobody falls in love with a tax return.",
