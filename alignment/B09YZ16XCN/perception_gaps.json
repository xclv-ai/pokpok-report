    "evidence": "WWW: 'Dermatologist tested' (Pure) vs. PDP: 'Omega-fatty acids + Botanicals' (Hybrid)",
    "why_matters": "When you add 'nature' to a 'clinical' brand, you don't always get the best of both worlds; often, you just weaken the authority of the science. The Amazon listing suggests a natural remedy, while the site sells a medical intervention.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are flirting with the 'Natural' trend on Amazon to catch keywords, but your soul is synthetic and clinical. The choice is binary: either purge the botanical fluff from Amazon to own the 'Medical Grade' slot completely (Option A), or rebrand the entire line as 'Clinical Naturals' to chase the clean beauty market (Option B).

    "evidence": "WWW: 'Reliable staple' (Utility) vs. PDP: 'Product of the Year / Gold Branding' (Premium)",
    "why_matters": "Amazon is successfully framing this as an affordable luxury, while the website still frames it as a utility commodity. This leaves money on the table. The brand is worth more than the website thinks it is.",
    "the_hard_choice": "Your Amazon listing proves consumers will treat this as a premium 'Age Renew' treatment, yet your website treats it like basic lotion.

    "evidence": "WWW: '82% of users' (The Stat) vs. PDP: 'Omega-fatty acids + Antioxidants' (The Logic)",
    "why_matters": "On the site, you demand blind faith in the clinic. On Amazon, you try to explain the chemistry. This inconsistency in 'how you convince' fractures the user's understanding of why the product works.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You are currently split between treating the customer like a patient (who needs stats) and a student (who needs education). You must choose: either dumb down the Amazon page to pure statistical brute force (Option A), or elevate the website to explain the 'Why' behind the chemistry (Option B). A brand that explains itself half the time looks unsure."

    "why_matters": "You have achieved perfect consistency in being boring. In a 'TikTok made me buy it' world, 'Clinical Authority' without a spark of 'Magician' or 'Ruler' creates trust but not desire.",
    "the_hard_choice": "You have successfully built a brand that no one hates, but also one that no one loves. The data shows a safe, steady pulse. You face a strategic pivot: either stay the course as the 'Boring but Effective' choice (Option A), or inject a calculated dose of 'Ruler' arrogance to wake up the audience (Option B).

You must decide: either modernize the website to match the 'Tech-Forward' energy of the marketplace (Option A), or drag the Amazon page back to the 1990s to maintain your traditional heritage (Option B). Nostalgia is not a strategy for 'Age Defense'."
