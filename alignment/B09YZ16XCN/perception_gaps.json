    "why_matters": "Evocative messaging builds desire and brand equity (people buy the *feeling*). Rational messaging builds a transaction (people buy the *function*). Converting desire into logic lowers your price ceiling—poetry sells for a premium; spec sheets sell for the lowest bid.",

    "why_matters": "In the modern beauty landscape, '50,000 obsessed fans' is often more powerful than '94% clinical improvement.'

    "do_this_now": "Elevate the 'Scope' slider. Don't just sell 'Crepe Correction' (1/5); sell 'Age Confidence' or 'Body Joy' (3/5). Use the A+ header to frame the product as part of a larger self-care ritual, not just a spot-treatment tool."
