    "gap_description": "Your Visual Identity Strategy prescribes 'Earthy Organic' with a controlled, white-and-gold palette (Entropy 2/5). The Amazon PDP delivers 'Gen-Z Pop' with saturated pinks and floating hearts (Entropy 4/5). You have traded the authority of a derm-brand for the aesthetic of a candy shop.",
    "evidence": "[VISUAL IDENTITY] Strategy: 'Earthy Organic (Neutral/Structured)' vs. Reality: 'Gen-Z Pop (Hot/Playful)'",
    "why_matters": "Visual consistency is the first cue of trust. By completely abandoning the 'Clinical White' equity of the master brand, the PDP looks like a white-label novelty item rather than a Jergens product. You risk the product being perceived as a gimmick rather than serious skincare.",

    "evidence": "[TONE OF VOICE] Strategy: 'Gentle Guide (Professional)' vs. Reality: 'Hype Beast (Slang/Manic)'",
    "why_matters": "When a 'Caregiver' brand suddenly starts using 'Slang' (5/5) and 'Cheeky' respect levels (4/5), it feels performative. It erodes the perceived expertise. A dermatologist doesn't say 'Love at first squish!'—and you are claiming dermatologist validation.",
    "do_this_now": "Dial back the 'Enthusiasm' slider in the bullet points. Remove 50% of the exclamation points. Rewrite the 'Squish' claims to pair them immediately with a functional benefit (e.g., 'Fun to squish, serious about hydration')."

    "why_matters": "The Jester is great for viral awareness but terrible for retention. If the customer buys you for the 'joke' (the squish), they leave when the joke gets old. The Caregiver equity is what drives lifetime value. You are trading long-term trust for short-term likes.",

    "evidence": "[FUNCTIONAL BENEFITS] Alignment: 100% | Risk: Form factor (Bursts) overshadows function (Hydration)",
    "why_matters": "Novelty products have a short half-life. If the Amazon shopper buys this as a 'cute gift' but doesn't believe in the '24-hour hydration,' they won't replenish. The 'Toy' positioning undermines the 'Skincare' reality.",
    "do_this_now": "Add a 'Science of the Burst' graphic in the image carousel. Visually deconstruct the burst to show the 'Hydralucence' core inside the 'Squishy' shell, proving that the form factor serves the function, not just the fun."
