    "gap_description": "Your Strategy defines the purchase as a statement of 'Trend-Setting' (Relevance), but the PDP reframes it purely as 'Pragmatism' (Rationality) due to the low price and 'Stocking Stuffer' focus. You are trading cultural currency for volume. While you are undeniably popular, you are training customers to treat this as a disposable knick-knack rather than a desired beauty item.",

    "evidence": "[NARRATIVE] Setting Gap: Strategy 'Harvest (4/5)' vs. Reality 'Studio (3/5)'",
