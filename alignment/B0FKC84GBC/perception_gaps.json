    "gap_description": "Your Strategy (WWW) profiles the brand as 'The Caregiver' (70%), focused on nurturing and relief. Amazon (PDP) completely flips this to 'The Jester' (70%), focusing on play, squishing, and entertainment. You are selling a medical solution on one channel and a toy on the other.",
    "evidence": "[ARCHETYPES] Strategy: 'The Caregiver (70%)' vs. Reality: 'The Jester (70%)'",
    "why_matters": "This disconnect erodes master brand equity. While the 'Jester' approach drives viral sales, it disconnects this product from the core 'Jergens' promise of serious skin health.

    "why_matters": "By treating your own product as a commodity ('Pragmatist') on your site, you depress its perceived value. Amazon proves this is a 'cool' purchase, not just a 'smart' one.

    "evidence": "[MISSION] Alignment: 90% | Drift: Scope slider moving from Optimization (2/5) to Lifestyle (3/5)",
    "why_matters": "Jergens' superpower is democratic access. If the narrative shifts too far into 'Lifestyle' (4/5), the brand begins to feel exclusive or performative, opening the door for a competitor to claim the 'honest, effective, cheap' territory you vacated.",
