    "gap_description": "Your Strategy defines the brand soul as 'The Lover' (65%)—sensual, nuzzly, and intimate. The PDP execution inverts this completely to 'The Jester' (60%)—loud, squishy, and entertaining. You are promising a romance but delivering a circus.",
    "evidence": "[ARCHETYPES] Strategy: Lover 65% (Sensual) vs. Reality: Jester 60% (Fun)",
    "why_matters": "This is a total shattering of brand equity. Customers attracted to the 'Cashmere/Nuzzly' promise of the website will find the 'Squish/OMG' tone of Amazon immature and jarring. You dilute the premium sensuality that justifies loyalty.",

    "gap_description": "The WWW strategy anchors authority in 'Bio-Active' ingredients (Shea/Nature), creating a 'Harmonizer' territory. The PDP abandons nature to sell 'Transformation' through novelty format (Bursts/Heart-shapes), shifting to 'The Empowerer'. You traded the garden for a toy store.",
    "evidence": "[PURPOSE] Strategy: 'The Harmonizer (Bio-Active)' vs. Reality: 'The Empowerer (Transformation)'",
    "why_matters": "When you shift from selling the *ingredient* (Shea) to selling the *format* (Bursts), you lose authority. Ingredients build long-term trust; novelty formats burn out once the trend fades. You are sacrificing longevity for a short-term viral spike.",

    "evidence": "[SELF-EXPRESSION] Strategy: 'The Pragmatist (Rationality)' vs. Reality: 'The Trend-Setter (Relevance)'",
    "why_matters": "Trend-Setters are fickle; they leave when the next cool thing arrives. Pragmatists build LTV (Lifetime Value). By positioning solely as a viral hit, you risk high churn rates once the 'hype' moves to the next brand.",

    "why_matters": "Gen-Z smells performative marketing instantly. The gap between 'cool bestie' and 'cringe corporate' is razor thin. If you push the enthusiasm slider any higher, you cross into parody, losing the respect of the very audience you're courting.",
    "do_this_now": "Implement a 'Cringe Check' in your copy guidelines. Limit exclamation points to 3 per module. Remove 'OMG' and 'Smoosh' from the main title and bullets; keep the slang contained to the creative visuals where it feels more native."
