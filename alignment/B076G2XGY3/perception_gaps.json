The PDP shifts to 'Heritage & Craft' (Balanced/Evidence), leaning heavily on the '110 Years' legacy and 'World's No. 1' status to bully the user into trust.

    "evidence": "[FUNCTIONAL BENEFITS] Strategy: 'Hydration' (Action 2/5) vs. Reality: 'Restoration' (Action 4/5)",
    "why_matters": "This disconnect confuses the use case. A customer buying for 'daily maintenance' (Strategy) will find the 'restorative' formula (Reality) too heavy/greasy, leading to negative reviews about texture. A customer seeking repair won't believe the maintenance messaging.",
