The PDP delivers 'The Medical Authority' with a 'Professional' aesthetic (2/5) aimed at the medicine cabinet. You are trying to sell a 'Treat' but looking like a 'Tool'.",
    "evidence": "[POSITIONING] Strategy: 'Polished Masstige (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Professional Bulk Utility (2/5)'",
    "why_matters": "When you look like a clinical utility product, you lose the emotional pricing power of 'Masstige.' Customers buy tools on price/volume (which explains your bulk pack focus), but they buy treats on desire. You are trading margin and loyalty for commodity volume.",

    "evidence": "[MESSAGING] Strategy: 'Evocative (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'Rational (2/5)'",
    "why_matters": "Persuading via 'Repair' limits your audience to people with problems (dry skin). Persuading via 'Dream' opens your audience to anyone seeking pleasure. The 'Repair' framing makes the product a chore; the 'Dream' framing makes it a ritual.",

    "evidence": "[KEY SELLING POINTS] Strategy: 'The Users (4/5)' vs. Reality: 'The Lab (2/5)'",

    "do_this_now": "Swap the 'Dermatologist Tested' badge in the main image stack for a 'Viral Favorite' or 'Top Rated' badge. Ensure the first A+ module features a quote from a user about the *scent*, not a statistic about hydration hours."
