    "description": "La Roche-Posay positions itself as the ultimate emergency room for your skin. It strips away all vanity and fluff to focus entirely on biological restoration and safety. By combining 'Dermatological Laboratory' authority with accessible pricing, it acts as the Pragmatic Healer—the product you reach for when the fun stops and you just need your skin to stop hurting."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Medical Healer",
      "description": "The brand's authority is strictly clinical, rooted in the 'Dermatological Laboratory' and validated by white-coat experts. It operates as a Healer, prioritizing the restoration of damaged skin over aesthetic enhancement. The strategy is The Medical Authority, selling a sterile, prescription-grade aesthetic at a Masstige price point."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Stoic Specialist",
      "description": "The brand maintains a distinct professional distance, acting as The Reliable Expert rather than a friend. Dominated by The Caregiver (60%) archetype expressed through Sage (30%) methodology, it projects safety and competence. The visual code is Pharma-Code—sterile white and clinical blue—while the voice remains a Clinical Authority: dry, precise, and devoid of humor."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Rational Problem Solving",
      "description": "The messaging ignores emotion to focus on The Problem Solver logic—identifying a pathology ('Dry Skin Irritations') and offering a chemical fix ('Panthenol + Madecassoside'). The USP is The Specialist, owning the specific niche of barrier repair. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, where science tames nature (Thermal Water) to serve the patient."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Safety",
      "description": "Functionally, the product acts as a Healer, repairing the skin barrier to stop irritation. The payoff is Emotional Relief—the removal of pain and anxiety ('Sanctuary'). Socially, it offers The Safe Choice, allowing the user to signal rational, pragmatist values ('I buy what works') rather than status."
