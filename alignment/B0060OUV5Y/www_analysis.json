    "headline": "The Practical Guardian",
    "description": "Aquaphor feels like the ultimate utilitarian safety net. It completely rejects aesthetic fluff to focus entirely on clinical efficacy and problem-solving versatility. It differentiates itself through its 'Swiss Army Knife' functionality—a single, affordable tool that fixes almost any skin issue (chafing, dryness, windburn) for the entire family."

      "title": "The Medical Healer",
      "description": "The brand is anchored in the clinic, deriving authority entirely from 'Dermatologist Recommendations' rather than nature or lifestyle.

Dominated by The Caregiver archetype (70%), it signals protection and service through a rigid Pharma-Code visual identity (Clinical Blue/White). The tone is a Modern Minimalist—direct, efficient, and devoid of humor."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Clinical Solution",
      "description": "The messaging is functional, hooking the user with the 'Problem' (Chapped skin) and the 'Solution' (Healing). The USP is The Specialist—owning the 'Healing Ointment' category. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough story, relying on the 'Dermatologist Recommended' badge to serve as the ultimate trust anchor."
