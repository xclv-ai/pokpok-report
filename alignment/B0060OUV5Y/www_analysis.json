    "headline": "The Clinical Pragmatist",
    "description": "Aquaphor acts as the universal 'fix-it' tool for skin, stripping away all marketing fluff to deliver pure, unadulterated efficacy. It feels like a medical prescription that you can buy without a doctor, occupying the role of the reliable family guardian that prioritizes safety and results over aesthetics or trends. It is the ultimate 'Safe Choice'—a product bought not for joy, but for the guaranteed absence of pain."

      "title": "The Medical Authority",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority entirely in the clinic, leaning on 'Dermatologist Recommended' credentials to justify its existence as a Healer. Its value system is Safety First, sacrificing sensory pleasure (greasy, heavy) for guaranteed tolerance on the most sensitive skin. Positioned as The Medical Authority, it offers a utilitarian tool for restoration at a democratic price point."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Sterile Caregiver",
      "description": "The distance between brand and user is professional and respectful, like a nurse practitioner. Dominated by The Caregiver (70%) archetype, it protects and soothes without emotional excess. The visual identity is pure Pharma-Code—clinical white and blue—supported by a Clinical Authority tone that speaks in instructions and facts."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "The Problem Solver",
      "description": "The messaging leads with the result—'Healing'—and backs it with Rational persuasion using terms like 'Clinically proven.' The USP is The Specialist, owning the solution for 'dry, cracked skin' via a proprietary formula (Petrolatum + Panthenol). The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, positioning the product as a triumph of formulation over nature."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Relief",
      "description": "Functionally, it is The Fixer, repairing damaged barriers with aggressive occlusion. The emotional payoff is Relief/Safety—the cessation of discomfort and the assurance of harmlessness. Socially, it is The Safe Choice, signaling a pragmatic rejection of hype in favor of what 'just works.'"
