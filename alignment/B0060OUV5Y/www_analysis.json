    "description": "La Roche-Posay projects the ultimate 'Medical Authority'—a brand that functions as a sterile, reliable extension of the dermatologist's office. It strips away all lifestyle fluff to focus entirely on 'Therapeutic' intervention, positioning itself not as a beauty product but as a necessary tool for skin health and recovery. It feels like a prescription you can buy without a script."

      "title": "The Medical Healer",
      "description": "The brand rejects aesthetic positioning to occupy the 'Pharmacy' slot (Medical Authority) completely. Its Purpose is purely 'Restorative'—fixing broken barriers rather than enhancing glow. Value-wise, it adheres to 'Safety First', sacrificing potency or trendiness to guarantee tolerance for the most vulnerable skins (babies, chemo patients)."

    "identity": {
      "title": "Sterile Expertise",
      "description": "The distance between brand and user is significant; this is The Specialist speaking to a patient, not a friend. Dominated by The Caregiver (60%) and The Sage (30%), it uses a Pharma-Code visual identity (white, blue, sterile) to signal absolute competence. The tone is Clinical Authority—grave, precise, and devoid of humor."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Functional Problem-Solving",
      "description": "Messaging is stripped of poetry, focusing entirely on 'The Problem' (Irritations, Diaper Rash) and the 'Component' (Tribioma, B5). The USP is that of The Specialist—the go-to tube for specific medical crises like post-laser care. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, citing proprietary complexes and rigorous testing as the only story that matters."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Safe Restoration",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Healer, acting as a 'bandage' for damaged skin. The Emotional payoff is Relief—the cessation of panic/pain rather than the addition of joy. Socially, it represents The Safe Choice, offering the user the pragmatic comfort of a product that 'just works' and is endorsed by the medical establishment."
