    "description": "Cicaplast Balm B5+ is not skincare; it is a medical intervention in a tube. It positions itself as the ultimate 'Break Glass in Case of Emergency' product for the skin, leveraging intense clinical authority (Dermatologists, Chemotherapy-safe) to promise absolute safety. It plays the role of the stoic doctor, prioritizing biological repair over aesthetic pleasure."

      "title": "The Medical Authority",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority strictly in the clinic, prioritizing 'Dermatologist Tested' validation over natural origin.

      "title": "The Sterile Caregiver",
      "description": "The brand maintains a distinct professional distance, acting as a 'Specialist' rather than a friend. Dominated by The Caregiver (65%) archetype expressed through a Pharma-Code visual identity (blinding white, medical blue), it signals uncompromising safety. The tone is Clinical Authority—grave, precise, and devoid of humor."

      "title": "Functional Problem Solver",
      "description": "The messaging ignores emotion to focus on the 'Problem' (cracked skin) and the 'Result' (soothing). The USP is The Specialist, owning the niche of 'SOS Repair' via a proprietary complex (Tribioma™). The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, building trust through clinical trials rather than founder stories."
