    "description": "La Roche-Posay Cicaplast is the ultimate 'Fire Extinguisher' for skin. It strips away all vanity and emotion to position itself as a piece of medical equipment—a sterile, precise tool for urgent biological repair. It functions as the unquestioned Medical Authority in the bathroom cabinet, bridging the gap between a pharmaceutical prescription and a daily moisturizer."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Healing Authority",
      "description": "The brand is anchored purely in the Clinical Lab, acting as The Healer for pathological skin issues rather than aesthetic desires. By prioritizing Safety First (babies, post-radiation) over potency or sensory pleasure, it establishes absolute trust. The strategy is Medical Authority—selling a specialized 'cure' at a democratic price point."

      "title": "The Sterile Sage",
      "description": "The distance between brand and user is significant; this is The Reliable Expert speaking to a patient, not a friend. Dominated by The Sage archetype (60%), it relies on data, patents ('Tribioma'), and sterility to project competence. The Visual Identity is Pharma-Code—white, blue, and grid-aligned—signaling that this product belongs in a hospital, not a spa."

      "title": "Molecular Education",
      "description": "The messaging is that of The Chemist, hooking the user with molecule names ('Vitamin B5', 'Madecassoside') rather than poetic benefits. The USP is The Specialist, claiming ownership over 'Skin Recovery' for specific medical conditions. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, using Science Education to prove efficacy through diagrams and dermatologist endorsements."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Biological Relief",
      "description": "Functionally, it offers Restoration, fixing broken barriers and soothing irritation rather than enhancing beauty. The payoff is Relief/Safety—the absence of pain and the assurance of tolerance. Socially, it is The Safe Choice, allowing the user to signal they are a Pragmatist who trusts science over hype."
