    "headline": "The Clinical Savior",
    "description": "La Roche-Posay Cicaplast is the emergency room for your skin. It positions itself not as a cosmetic enhancement, but as a medical necessity for 'cracked,' 'chafed,' and 'irritated' skin. By leveraging heavy dermatologist authority and safety certifications (Baby Safe, Chemo Safe), it functions as the trusted Caregiver that fixes what the world has broken."

      "title": "The Medical Democratizer",
      "description": "The brand adopts a strict Healer stance, deriving authority from clinical validation ('Recommended by 100,000 dermatologists') rather than nature stories. It balances this with a Safety First value system, prioritizing tolerance for the most vulnerable (babies, chemo patients). The strategy is The Medical Authority—making pharmacy-grade repair accessible to the masses."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Reliable Caregiver",
      "description": "The distance is Professional—the brand stands as a Specialist (The Reliable Expert) offering a diagnosis, not a hug. Dominated by The Caregiver (60%) and The Sage (30%), it uses Pharma-Code visuals (sterile white and blue) to signal hygiene and precision. The voice is Clinical—grave, serious, and instructional."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Dermatological Education",
      "description": "The messaging is strictly Rational, hooking the user with The Molecule (Panthenol, TribioMa) rather than poetic benefits. The USP is The Specialist, owning the 'barrier repair' space for damaged skin. It focuses on Science Education, using diagrams and icons to prove efficacy rather than inspire desire."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Safety",
      "description": "Functionally, it is Pure Restoration—actively fixing broken barriers and healing wounds. The payoff is Emotional Relief—the absence of pain and the safety of a 'chemo-safe' formula. Socially, it represents The Safe Choice, offering the security of a product validated by the entire medical community."
