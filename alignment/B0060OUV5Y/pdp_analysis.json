    "description": "La Roche-Posay occupies the role of the emergency responder for skin. It strips away all vanity and lifestyle fluff to focus entirely on pathology correction and barrier repair. It feels like a prescription product that happens to be sold over the counter—a sterile, authoritative tool for when safety is the only metric that matters."

      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the clinic, not the garden. It operates as a Healer, viewing skin conditions as pathologies to be fixed rather than flaws to be hidden. The positioning is pure Medical Authority—sacrificing aesthetic pleasure for the promise of 'baby-safe' tolerance."

      "title": "The Sterile Guardian",
      "description": "There is a significant professional distance between brand and user; it behaves like a dermatologist, not a friend. Dominated by The Caregiver archetype (60%), it uses a sterile Pharma-Code visual identity (white/blue, charts) to signal absolute safety. The tone is Clinical Authority—grave, precise, and devoid of humor."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Diagnostic Education",
      "description": "The messaging targets the 'Molecule' and the 'Problem,' persuading through data and percentages (5% Panthenol) rather than emotion. The USP is The Specialist—owning the solution for specific damage (cracked, chafed). The focus is entirely on Science Education, using diagrams to prove mechanism of action."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Critical Restoration",
      "description": "Functionally, it acts as a Fixer, repairing broken barriers and healing wounds. The emotional payoff is Relief—the cessation of pain and anxiety. Socially, it represents The Safe Choice, allowing the user to outsource their worry to the consensus of '100,000 dermatologists.'"
