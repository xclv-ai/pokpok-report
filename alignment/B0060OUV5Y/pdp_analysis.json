    "description": "La Roche-Posay operates not as a beauty brand, but as a medical necessity. It positions itself as the ultimate safety net for compromised skin—from newborns to chemotherapy patients—using the sterile authority of the pharmacy to promise repair. It is devoid of romance or trend, focusing entirely on being the reliable 'white coat' in your bathroom cabinet."
