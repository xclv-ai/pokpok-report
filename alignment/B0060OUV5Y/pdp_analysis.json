    "description": "La Roche-Posay acts as the emergency room for your bathroom cabinet. It completely rejects cosmetic allure to function as a high-trust, low-risk medical intervention for damaged skin. It plays the role of the serious, white-coated specialist who doesn't care about 'glow' but cares deeply about biological repair and safety for the most vulnerable (babies, chemotherapy patients)."

The visual identity is pure Pharma-Code: sterile white, medical blue, and zero clutter."

The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, citing microbiome science as the hero. The focus is Science Education, using the PDP to teach mechanism of action rather than inspire desire."
