    "headline": "The Clinical Savior",
    "description": "La Roche-Posay positions Cicaplast as a medical-grade fire extinguisher for the skin. It feels less like a beauty product and more like a prescription you don't need a doctor for—sterile, serious, and focused entirely on urgent repair. By anchoring on 'chemotherapy-safe' and 'baby-safe' claims, it establishes itself as the ultimate safety net for vulnerable skin."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Medical Authority",
      "description": "The brand derives absolute authority from the clinic, not the garden, functioning as a Healer for pathologies (cracked skin, diaper rash) rather than cosmetic flaws. It operates as a Medical Authority, using 'Healing Ointment' terminology and sterile aesthetics to justify a Masstige price point. The payoff is not 'glow'; it is the cessation of suffering."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Sterile Caregiver",
      "description": "The brand maintains a Distant professional distance, acting as The Reliable Expert who treats you, not a friend who hugs you. Dominated by The Caregiver (60%) through a lens of clinical rigor, the visual code is pure Pharma-Code—white, blue, and grid-based. The tone is The Clinical Authority: dry, precise, and devoid of humor."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Rational Education",
      "description": "Messaging hooks the user with The Molecule (Vitamin B5, Dimethicone) and persuades through Rational efficacy claims. The USP is The Specialist, owning the 'Healing' niche for specific skin traumas. The focus is Science Education, using comparison charts and ingredient deep-dives to teach mechanism rather than inspire desire."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Biological Restoration",
      "description": "Functionally, it is The Fixer, aggressively repairing the skin barrier rather than just moisturizing. The emotional payoff is Relief/Safety—the removal of panic regarding irritation or reaction. Socially, it is The Safe Choice, signaling a Pragmatist's reliance on 'what the doctors use' over trends."
