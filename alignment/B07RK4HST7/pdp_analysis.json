    "description": "CeraVe acts as the 'Medical Authority' of the skincare aisle, stripping away all emotion and marketing fluff to focus entirely on barrier restoration. It positions itself not as a beauty product, but as a piece of healthcare infrastructure—essential, functional, and endorsed by the highest authority (Dermatologists). It feels like a prescription you don't need a prescription for."

      "title": "The Educational Chemist",
      "description": "Messaging is strictly rational, using the 'Molecule' (Ceramides) as the primary hook rather than an emotional promise. The Narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, citing patents and professionals as the origin. The Focus is deep Science Education, treating the PDP like a textbook to prove efficacy through mechanism."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Barrier Restoration",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Repair mechanism, focused on 'Restoring the protective barrier' rather than just moisturizing. The Emotional payoff is Relief—the absence of irritation or worry. Socially, it is The Safe Choice, allowing the user to blend in with the Majority who prioritize rational health over status."
