    "description": "CeraVe functions as the ultimate 'White Coat' for the masses, effectively stripping away the mystique of dermatology to deliver pure, unadulterated clinical function. It feels like a prescription you can buy without a copay—sterile, safe, and undeniably effective.

The USP is The Tech Engineer, claiming ownership of the 'MVE Technology' delivery system. The narrative serves as Science Education, using the PDP as a classroom to teach barrier function rather than inspire desire."
