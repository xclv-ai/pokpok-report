      "title": "The Barrier Guardian",
      "description": "The brand derives absolute authority from 'Dermatologists' and the 'Lab,' strictly positioning itself as a Healer that fixes biological failures (broken barriers).

      "title": "The Sterile Expert",
      "description": "The distance between brand and user is professional and guarded, like a doctor-patient relationship. Dominated by The Caregiver and Sage archetypes, it uses Pharma-Code visuals—sterile whites and hospital blues—to signal total competence.

The USP is the Tech Engineer, claiming ownership of the delivery system (MVE Technology). The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, framing the product as a solution engineered by experts, not birthed by nature."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Safety",
