    "description": "CeraVe eliminates the gap between the pharmacy counter and the beauty aisle. It feels like a prescription product that doesn't require a prescription, trading aspiration and romance for absolute biological certainty. It plays the role of the Accessible Expert, providing high-level dermatological science (Ceramides, MVE) in a utilitarian package that signals safety above all else."

Positioned as The Medical Authority, it democratizes serious skincare science for the mass market."

      "title": "The Reliable Stoic",
      "description": "There is a distinct professional distance between brand and user; it behaves like a dermatologist, not a friend. Dominated by The Sage archetype (60%), it relies on data and truth to build trust. The visual identity is Pharma-Code—sterile whites and medical blues that signal 'this works' without needing to shout."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Dermatological Logic",
      "description": "The messaging is strictly Rational, hooking the user with Ingredients (Ceramides) and Technology (MVE) rather than dreams. The USP is The Ingredient King, owning the mental link to 'Ceramides.' The narrative creates a Lab Breakthrough origin story that focuses on educating the user about their own biology."

      "title": "Biological Restoration",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Healer, focused on restoring the compromised skin barrier through biological inputs. The payoff is Emotional Safety—the relief of knowing the skin is protected and 'normal.' Socially, it is The Safe Choice, a pragmatic badge of intelligence that rejects marketing fluff for proven results."
