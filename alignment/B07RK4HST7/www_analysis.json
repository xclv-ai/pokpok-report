    "headline": "The Medical Standard",
    "description": "CeraVe is the anti-marketing brand. It strips away all vanity, luxury, and romance to position itself as a piece of medical infrastructure rather than a beauty product. By leveraging the absolute authority of dermatologists and the visual codes of the pharmacy, it offers a 'Generic Drug' aesthetic that signals maximum efficacy and zero markup."

      "title": "The Healing Authority",
      "description": "The brand is anchored purely in the Clinical Lab, with a Purpose defined by 'Restoration' of the skin barrier rather than aesthetic enhancement. It operates as The Medical Authority, selling a Daily Essential utility that prioritizes biological health over sensory pleasure. The strategy is to act as the 'Doctor's Choice' for the mass market."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Sterile Sage",
      "description": "There is a distinct professional distance here; the brand behaves like a board-certified specialist, not a friend. Dominated by The Sage archetype, it projects competence through a Pharma-Code visual identity (white, blue, diagrams). The tone is The Clinical Authority—dry, factual, and devoid of emotion to maximize trust."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Rational Chemistry",
      "description": "The messaging leads with The Molecule ('Ceramides') and persuades through Raw Data ('MVE Technology'), firmly occupying The Chemist territory. The Narrative is a Lab Breakthrough story where faceless dermatologists are the heroes. The focus is Deep Education, turning the PDP into a textbook to prove the thesis."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Biological Restoration",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Restoration engine, fixing the biological barrier to solve problems like eczema. The Emotional payoff is Safety—the removal of anxiety and irritation. Socially, it represents The Safe Choice, allowing users to blend into The Majority with a pragmatic tool that signals rationality."
