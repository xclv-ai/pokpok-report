    "description": "Aquaphor transforms clinical slime (petrolatum) into essential athletic gear. By packaging a medical-grade protectant into a 'mess-free' stick, they shift the brand from the medicine cabinet to the gym bag—positioning skin repair as a performance enabler rather than just damage control. It feels like a reliable spotter in the gym: silent, strong, and purely functional."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Democratic Healer",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the clinic ('Dermatologist recommended') but directs its mission toward mass accessibility. It operates as a Healer, treating specific pathologies like 'cracked heels' and 'chafing' without the velvet rope of high pricing. The value system is Safety First—sacrificing sensory elegance for 'Hypoallergenic' efficacy."

      "title": "The Clinical Stabilizer",
      "description": "The distance between brand and user is Professional—it speaks like a doctor, not a friend. Dominated by The Caregiver (60%) and The Hero (25%), it uses a Pharma-Code visual identity (Navy/White/Red) to signal absolute stability. The tone is The Clinical Authority: dry, factual Q&A that prioritizes clarity over entertainment."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Functional Problem Solver",
      "description": "The messaging is a direct prescription: it identifies a problem ('Chapped, chafed') and offers a mechanical fix. The USP is The Specialist, claiming ownership of the 'Healing' category in a specialized stick format. The focus is purely educational and validation-based, using icons and claims to prove competence."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Pragmatism",
      "description": "Functionally, it acts as a Restoration tool, fixing broken skin barriers and shielding against friction. The emotional payoff is Relief and Readiness—removing the distraction of pain so you can be active. Socially, it is The Safe Choice, signaling a pragmatic reliance on the 'Majority' consensus."
