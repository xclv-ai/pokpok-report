    "headline": "The Portable Healer",
    "description": "Aquaphor takes its reputation as the 'Swiss Army Knife' of skincare and packages it into a gym-ready tool. It strips away all emotion to focus entirely on functional problem-solving—fixing chafing, cracking, and dryness with clinical efficiency. This is not a beauty product; it is a first-aid kit essential that has been adapted for the active lifestyle."

      "title": "The Clinical Guardian",
      "description": "The brand stands firmly as The Medical Authority, deriving its power from the dermatology clinic rather than the spa. Its purpose is specific: to act as The Healer for broken, irritated skin, prioritizing Safety First over sensory pleasure. By pricing this utility at under $10, they function as Democratizers, making clinical-grade skin repair accessible to the masses."

      "title": "The Stoic Stabilizer",
      "description": "The distance between brand and user is professional—The Reliable Expert speaking to a patient. Dominated by The Caregiver (60%) and Sage (25%) archetypes, it uses a Pharma-Code visual identity (navy, white, red) to signal absolute sterility and trust. The tone is The Clinical Authority: dry, direct, and completely devoid of humor."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Functional Specialist",
      "description": "The messaging acts as The Problem Solver, hooking the user with specific relief claims ('Chafing', 'Cracked Heels') rather than ingredients. The USP lies in being The Specialist—offering a unique delivery system (Stick) for specific friction-related problems. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, citing 'Dermatologist Recommended' as the ultimate trust anchor."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Mess-Free Restoration",
      "description": "Functionally, it provides Restoration, physically repairing the skin barrier. The emotional payoff is Relief/Safety—the absence of pain and the reassurance of protection. Socially, it is The Safe Choice and The Pragmatist's badge, signaling a rational purchase decision driven by utility rather than hype."
