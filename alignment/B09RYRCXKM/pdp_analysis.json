    "description": "Aquaphor positions itself as the ultimate utilitarian shield for the active body.

      "title": "The Medical Guardian",
      "description": "The brand acts as a Healer, deriving authority from clinical efficacy (Petrolatum) rather than nature, despite the addition of avocado oil. It operates within a Safety First value system, prioritizing 'Hypoallergenic' tolerance above all else.

      "description": "The distance is professional and respectful; it speaks like a doctor or a coach. Dominated by The Caregiver archetype (60%) with a strong Hero (20%) streak for the active lifestyle angle, it uses Pharma-Code visuals to signal absolute safety. The tone is The Modern Minimalist—direct, Q&A style, and void of fluff."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Problem-Solving Logic",
      "description": "The messaging hooks with The Problem ('Chapped', 'Chafed') and persuades with Rational data ('Skin Protectant', 'Dermatologist Recommended'). The USP is The Specialist, targeting specific friction points of the body. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, where safety is engineered, not harvested."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Readiness",
      "description": "Functionally, it offers Restoration and Protection, physically sealing the skin barrier. Emotionally, it provides Confidence—the readiness to be active without fear of pain. Socially, it is The Safe Choice, a pragmatic badge of the 'Mainstream' user who values function over flash."
