    "description": "Aquaphor acts as the ultimate utilitarian problem-solver, stripping away all marketing fluff to deliver pharmaceutical-grade relief. It occupies the role of the Reliable Expert in the user's life—a medical staple adapted for the gym bag. The brand feels like a trusted doctor who prioritizes efficacy over aesthetics, offering a mess-free tool for active recovery."

      "title": "The Medical Authority",
      "description": "The brand anchors firmly in clinical validation ('Dermatologist Recommended'), rejecting natural wisdom for lab-tested efficacy (Petrolatum). It adopts a Safety First value system, sacrificing potency for hypoallergenic tolerance suitable for 'compromised skin.' The strategy is pure Medical Authority—pricing a clinical solution at a Democratic tier to ensure universal access to healing."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Reliable Expert",
      "description": "The distance between brand and user is professional and guarded; it speaks as a specialist, not a friend. Dominated by The Caregiver (60%) archetype, it uses a Pharma-Code visual identity (navy, white, sterile) to signal safety and rigor. The voice is a Clinical Authority—dry, matter-of-fact, and focused entirely on the utility of the product."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Clinical Problem Solver",
      "description": "The messaging uses a Rational persuasion logic, targeting specific pathologies ('Cracked,' 'Chafed') rather than emotional dreams. The USP is The Specialist—owning the 'Healing' claim through a proprietary delivery format (Stick). The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, citing 'Dermatologist' approval as the ultimate trust anchor."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Relief",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Healer, actively repairing broken skin barriers and shielding against friction. The emotional payoff is Relief—the cessation of pain and worry ('Safety'). Socially, it is The Safe Choice, allowing the user to blend in with The Majority who trust the gold standard of drugstore skincare."
