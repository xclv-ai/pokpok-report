    "headline": "The Portable Healer",
    "description": "Aquaphor positions itself as the ultimate medical utility for the active lifestyle. It takes the trusted, sterile authority of a hospital ointment and repackages it into a 'mess-free' format for the gym bag. It plays the role of the Reliable Expert—promising not to pamper you, but to fix your broken skin mechanics (chafing, cracking) so you can keep moving."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Medical Democratizer",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the clinic, using 'Petrolatum' and 'Dermatologist recommended' as non-negotiable trust signals. It functions as a Healer, existing solely to fix pathology (cracked, chafed skin) rather than enhance beauty. Strategically, it is a Medical Authority accessible to all—delivering high-grade skin repair at a drugstore price point."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Stoic Caregiver",
      "description": "There is a significant professional distance here; the brand acts as a Specialist, not a peer. Dominated by The Caregiver archetype, it offers stability and protection through a Pharma-Code visual identity (Navy, White, Red). The tone is purely Clinical—zero humor, maximum precision, speaking in the language of symptoms and solutions."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Problem-Solving Education",
      "description": "The messaging is laser-focused on the Result ('Healing', 'Relief') backed by Rational data ('Clinically proven'). The USP is a format innovation—transforming a commodity ingredient into a convenient 'Stick' for specific problems. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, relying on the 'Tested and approved' stamp of approval rather than a founder's journey."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Utility",
      "description": "Functionally, this is a Restoration product, repairing broken barriers and shielding against friction. The payoff is Relief—the absence of pain or irritation. Socially, it is The Safe Choice, a Pragmatist's tool that signals rational health management rather than status or trend-chasing."
