    "description": "Aquaphor takes its legendary clinical authority out of the medicine cabinet and into the gym bag. By packaging its 'Healing' ointment heritage into a 'mess-free stick,' it transforms from a static bathroom staple into a dynamic tool for active lifestyles. It feels like a piece of medical equipment designed for runners—sterile, reliable, and ruthlessly effective at fixing the friction of life."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Accessible Guardian",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the clinic ('Dermatologist recommended') but directs its mission toward the track and trail. It balances a 'Do No Harm' value system (Hypoallergenic) with a 'Fix It Fast' mandate. Strategically, it occupies The Medical Authority slot, but democratizes it for the mass market, proving that pharmaceutical-grade protection doesn't need a prescription."
    },
    "identity": {
      "title": "The Active Expert",
      "description": "The brand maintains a Professional distance, acting as a Specialist rather than a peer. The dominant Caregiver archetype (60%) is energized by a secondary Explorer trait (20%), targeting 'active lifestyles.' Visually, it adheres to a strict Pharma-Code (Navy/White), ensuring that even in a 'gym bag' context, it signals absolute safety and sterility."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Clinical Problem Solving",
      "description": "The messaging leads with the Result ('Immediate Relief') rather than romance. The USP is The Specialist—owning the specific niche of 'chapped, chafed, and cracked' skin. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough story, relying on 'proven' ingredients like Petrolatum to act as a shield, focusing heavily on Explaining the mechanism of protection."
    },
    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Pragmatism",
      "description": "Functionally, it acts as The Healer, repairing broken skin barriers and preventing friction. The emotional payoff is Relief—the cessation of pain or worry. It serves as a Pragmatist's badge, signaling a rational refusal to buy into 'fluff' skincare, joining The Majority who simply want what works."
