    "headline": "The Portable Medic",
    "description": "Aquaphor takes the messy, trusted 'goop' from the medicine cabinet and engineers it into a tactical tool for the gym bag. It feels less like a beauty product and more like athletic equipment—a friction-reducing, wind-blocking shield for the active body. It occupies the role of the 'Field Medic,' offering the clinical authority of a dermatologist with the utility of a pocket knife."

      "title": "The Democratic Healer",
      "description": "The brand's authority is absolute Clinical Correction, rooting its power in the 'Dermatologist Recommended' seal rather than nature. It democratizes this medical-grade healing (Petrolatum) into a Daily Essential format accessible to everyone ($9.74). The strategy is pure Medical Authority: boring, safe, and effective."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Stoic Caregiver",
      "description": "The distance is Professional; the brand speaks down to you like a knowledgeable specialist, using a Q&A format to correct misconceptions. Dominated by The Caregiver (60%), it uses Pharma-Code visuals (Navy/White/Red) to signal safety. The voice is a Clinical Authority—dry, factual, and devoid of entertainment."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Problem-Solving Rationality",
      "description": "The messaging ignores poetry to target The Result—specifically 'Relief' and 'Protection.' The USP is a Specialist claim, owning the 'Healing' slot for problem skin (chafing, cracking). The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, emphasizing tested safety and ingredients over any founder story or origin myth."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Utility",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Healer, fixing broken skin barriers and shielding against friction. The emotional payoff is Relief—the absence of pain or irritation. Socially, it is The Pragmatist's choice: a rational, unsexy tool bought solely because it works."
