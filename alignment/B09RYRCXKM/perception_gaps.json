The PDP defaults to 'The Specialist' (The Hero), relying on the Aquaphor brand name rather than the format innovation.

    "why_matters": "When you rely on the brand name (Hero) instead of the innovation (Tech), you commoditize the new format. Shoppers will compare it to a tub of Aquaphor and see it as 'expensive Vaseline' rather than 'advanced mess-free engineering.' You lose the premium justification.",

You are drowning out the gentle safety signal with heavy-handed authority.",

    "why_matters": "The 'Sensitive Skin' shopper buys on safety (Free-From), not just authority. By burying the purity narrative under the heavy 'Dermatologist Recommended' banner, you risk alienating the hyper-allergic customer who needs to feel 'safe' before they feel 'validated.'",
