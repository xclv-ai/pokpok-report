    "gap_description": "Your Strategy sells the product based on what is ABSENT ('Free From', 'Hypoallergenic'), framing it as 'Formula Purity' for the cautious. The Amazon PDP sells it based on what is PRESENT ('Petrolatum', 'Clinically Proven'), framing it as 'Derm-Validation' for the desperate. You are confusing the buyer: is this a gentle shield for babies, or a heavy-duty chemical intervention?",
    "evidence": "[KEY SELLING POINTS] Strategy: 'Formula Purity' (The List: Free-From) vs. Reality: 'Derm-Validation' (The Graph: Clinical Proof)",
    "why_matters": "The 'Clean Beauty' shopper (Strategy target) sees Petrolatum and flees. The 'Heavy Repair' shopper (Amazon reality) sees 'Gentle/Baby' and doubts the potency. By splitting the narrative, you risk losing both the purist and the pragmatist to specialized competitors.",

    "gap_description": "On your website, you claim ownership of 'The System' (Semi-occlusive barrier), positioning the mechanics as proprietary engineering. On Amazon, this degrades to 'The Complex' (Petrolatum + Panthenol), which sounds like generic ingredients anyone can copy. You are voluntarily trading IP authority for ingredient transparency.",

The PDP softens the action to 'The Healer' (4/5) but hardens the outcome to 'Biological' (1/5). The Amazon page feels more medicinal and less restorative than the brand promise.",
    "evidence": "[FUNCTIONAL BENEFITS] Strategy: 'The Fixer (5/5)' vs. Reality: 'The Healer (4/5)'",
    "why_matters": "The shift from 'Sensory' to 'Biological' makes the product feel like a chore rather than a relief. Customers buy 'feeling better,' not just 'improved lipid layer.' This coldness reduces the emotional reward of the purchase.",

    "why_matters": "The 'Innocent' archetype provides the halo of safety that justifies the price. If you lean too hard into 'Hero/Active' imagery (sweat, gym, friction), you aggressively alienate the mother looking for gentle care. 'Strong' often implies 'Harsh' in skincare.",
