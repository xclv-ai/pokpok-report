    "description": "Aquaphor projects the unshakeable confidence of a medical standard. It strips away all vanity, romance, and aesthetic fluff to offer a pure, functional tool for repair. It feels like a piece of medical equipment that happens to be sold in a drugstore—essential, logic-driven, and trusted by authorities to fix the broken barrier."

It adopts a Safety First value system, prioritizing tolerance over potency. The positioning is The Medical Authority—utilitarian, sterile, and priced as a Daily Essential."

The Caregiver archetype dominates (70%), driven to protect and serve without seeking attention. The visual identity is Pharma-Code (white/blue sterile grid), and the tone is The Clinical Authority—dry, professional, and devoid of humor."

      "description": "Messaging focuses on The Problem Solver logic, hooking the user with the result ('Relief') backed by Rational persuasion. The USP is The Specialist, offering a specific format (Stick) for a specific problem (chafing/dryness). The focus is Science Education, using the page to explain the mechanism of 'semi-occlusive' healing."
