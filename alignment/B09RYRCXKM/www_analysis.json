    "description": "Aquaphor feels like a doctor's prescription that you can buy without a script.

      "title": "The Medical Healer",
      "description": "The brand's authority is absolute, grounded in the 'Dermatologist Recommended' claim rather than nature or lifestyle. It positions itself as a Medical Authority (The Doctor's Choice) offering a specific Restoration mission for damaged skin.

      "title": "The Sterile Guardian",
      "description": "The distance between brand and user is professional; it behaves like a Specialist, not a friend. Dominated by The Caregiver archetype, it uses a Pharma-Code visual identity (Navy, White, Red) to signal emergency relief. The tone is The Clinical Authority—dry, precise, and devoid of humor."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Problem-Solving Science",
      "description": "The messaging leads with the Result ('Immediate Relief') backed by a Rational argument ('Skin Protectant'). The USP is The Specialist—targeting specific problem areas (chafing, dryness) with a convenient format. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, relying on the 'Petrolatum' heritage to build trust."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Safety",
      "description": "Functionally, it acts as a Healer and a Shield, repairing the barrier while protecting against friction. The emotional payoff is Relief—the cessation of pain or discomfort. Socially, it is The Safe Choice, a pragmatic tool that signals intelligence through immunity to marketing fluff."
