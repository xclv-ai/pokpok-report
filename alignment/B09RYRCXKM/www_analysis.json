    "communication": {
      "title": "Functional Problem Solver",
      "description": "The messaging is purely Functional, targeting the 'Result' (Relief) via Rational persuasion. The USP is The Specialist, offering a specific format (Stick) for a specific problem (On-the-go repair). The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, relying on the 'Dermatologist Recommended' badge as the primary trust anchor."
