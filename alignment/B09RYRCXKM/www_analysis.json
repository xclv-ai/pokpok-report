    "description": "Aquaphor acts as the ultimate utilitarian healer, stripping away all marketing fluff to focus entirely on mechanical repair. It doesn't promise beauty or status; it promises the cessation of pain and the restoration of skin function through proven pharmaceutical ingredients. It feels like a medical tool rather than a cosmetic product, positioning itself as the reliable 'break-glass-in-case-of-emergency' solution for the entire family."

      "title": "The Medical Healer",
      "description": "The brand's authority is rooted firmly in the clinic, leveraging 'Dermatologist Recommended' status to justify its existence.

      "title": "The Sterile Caregiver",
      "description": "There is a professional distance here; the brand behaves like a competent nurse—efficient, not emotional. The Caregiver archetype (70%) dominates, but it's expressed through a Pharma-Code visual identity of navy blues and sterile whites. The tone is The Clinical Authority: dry, direct, and completely devoid of humor or slang."

    "communication": {
      "title": "Problem-Solution Logic",
      "description": "The messaging hook is immediate Functional Relief, bypassing emotion to sell the 'Fix.' The USP is a delivery system innovation—transforming a messy ointment into a 'Mess-Free Stick.' The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, relying on the '41% Petrolatum' spec sheet to prove efficacy rather than a founder's story."
