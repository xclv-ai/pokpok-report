    "headline": "The Clinical Pragmatist",
    "description": "Aquaphor is the ultimate utility player in skincare—a medical-grade tool disguised as a consumer product. It rejects all vanity and trend-chasing to occupy the position of The Medical Authority, offering pure, unglamorous competence. It feels like a prescription you don't need a doctor to buy, providing absolute safety and rational relief for the entire family."

    "foundation": {
      "title": "The Reliable Guardian",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the clinic, not the garden, functioning as a Healer that fixes broken skin barriers. By prioritizing Safety First values and a Utility price point, it acts as a Medical Authority accessible to the masses. It doesn't promise to make you beautiful; it promises to make you whole."

    "identity": {
      "title": "The Sterile Caregiver",
      "description": "The distance is Professional—the brand stands as a Reliable Expert, not a best friend. Dominated by The Caregiver archetype (60%) backed by The Sage, it uses a Pharma-Code visual identity (blue, white, sterile) to signal absolute trust. The voice is a Clinical Authority, speaking in the dry, helpful cadence of a pharmacist."
    },
    "communication": {
      "title": "Rational Problem Solving",
      "description": "The messaging leads with the Problem (Chapped Skin) and solves it with Rational proof (Dermatologist Recommended). The USP is The Specialist—owning the 'Healing' category through a semi-occlusive formula. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, relying on the 'white coat' halo rather than a founder's journey."

    "benefits": {
      "title": "Restorative Safety",
      "description": "Functionally, it is a Restoration engine, repairing damage with clinical efficiency. The emotional payoff is Relief—the cessation of pain and worry. Socially, it represents The Safe Choice, signaling that the user is a Pragmatist who values function over form."
