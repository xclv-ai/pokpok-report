    "description": "Aquaphor acts as the ultimate utilitarian problem-solver, rejecting all aesthetic fluff to focus entirely on clinical efficacy. It feels like a medical tool rather than a cosmetic product, occupying the role of the 'Reliable Expert' in the user's life—the thing you reach for when skin is actually broken or hurting. It offers zero emotional transcendence, trading purely in the currency of Relief and Safety."

      "title": "The Medical Healer",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority firmly in the clinic, not the garden, functioning as a Healer for specific pathologies rather than an optimizer of beauty. Its Safety First values dictate a 'Do No Harm' approach, prioritizing tolerance over aggressive potency. The strategy is purely Medical Authority—a utilitarian tool for the masses."

      "title": "The Sterile Caregiver",
      "description": "The brand maintains a distinct professional distance, acting as a Caregiver through competence rather than intimacy. The visual identity (based on input data) presents a 'Soft Clinical' vibe with sterile white backgrounds and authoritative typography. The tone is The Clinical Authority—serious, direct, and completely devoid of humor."

      "title": "Functional Problem Solver",
      "description": "Messaging focuses entirely on the 'Result' (Healing) using Rational persuasion rather than emotional storytelling. The USP is that of The Specialist—owning the specific problem of 'Extra Dry/Chapped Skin.' The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough story, relying on 'Dermatologist Recommended' credentials to build trust."

      "title": "Restorative Safety",
      "description": "Functionally, the product offers Restoration, physically repairing a broken skin barrier. The emotional payoff is Relief—the cessation of panic or discomfort. Socially, it represents The Safe Choice, allowing the user to blend in with the Majority who prioritize health over trends."
