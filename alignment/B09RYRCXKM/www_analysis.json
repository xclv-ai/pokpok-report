    "description": "Aquaphor translates its heavy-duty clinical heritage into a mobile, mess-free format without losing an ounce of authority.

      "title": "The Clinical Guardian",
      "description": "The brand anchors its authority in the clinic, not the spa, acting as a Healer for damaged skin. It prioritizes Safety First, sacrificing sensory frills for hypoallergenic tolerance.

      "title": "Problem-Solving Science",
      "description": "The messaging bypasses emotion to target specific pain points (Chapped, Chafed) as a Problem Solver. The USP is the Delivery System—transforming a messy ointment into a precise Stick. The narrative is a Lab Breakthrough, relying on the 'Dermatologist Recommended' badge as the ultimate trust anchor."
