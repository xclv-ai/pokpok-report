      "title": "The Gentle Harmonizer",
      "description": "The brand rejects clinical sterility to position itself as a Harmonizer, anchoring its authority in the garden (Shea) rather than the lab.

      "title": "The Hype-Beast Lover",
      "description": "There is zero distance between brand and user; it feels like a text message from a BFF. Dominated by The Lover archetype (65%), it uses high-warmth Gen-Z Pop visuals to seduce the senses.

    "communication": {
      "title": "Romantic Alchemist",
      "description": "The messaging ignores cold data to focus on Evocative persuasion, selling the 'Dream' of the scent. The USP is the Ingredient King—owning the mental link to 'Shea.' The narrative is a Green Lab story, optimizing a natural harvest to create a Lifestyle Aesthetic that prioritizes desire over education."
