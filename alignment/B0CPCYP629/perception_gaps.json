You are marketing a lifestyle upgrade, but the shelf is selling a medical fix.",
    "evidence": "[FUNCTIONAL BENEFITS] Strategy: 'Hydration' (Maintenance 3/5) vs. PDP: 'Restoration' (Healer 4/5)",
    "why_matters": "This confuses the use case. If the customer buys it for 'Maintenance' but gets a heavy 'Healer' texture, they may find it too thick.
