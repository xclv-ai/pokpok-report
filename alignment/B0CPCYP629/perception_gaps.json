But the Amazon reality, driven by massive review volume and badges, has elevated it to 'The Trend-Setter' (Relevance). You are selling a $9 lotion; the internet is buying a viral status symbol.

    "evidence": "[PURPOSE] Strategy: 'Enhancement' (Goal 4/5) vs. Reality: 'Maintenance' (Goal 3/5)",
    "why_matters": "Maintenance is a chore; Enhancement is an aspiration. By framing the benefit as '24-hour hydration' (Maintenance) rather than 'Cashmere Skin' (Enhancement), you sound like a utility product rather than a beauty ritual. This lowers the perceived value of the sensory experience.",

    "evidence": "[ARCHETYPES] Strategy: Secondary Jester (Fun) vs. Reality: Secondary Everyman (Safe)",
    "why_matters": "The 'Jester' is what separates eos from Nivea or Aveeno. If you lose the wit to become purely 'accessible' (Everyman), you lose your distinct voice in a crowded 'Safe Choice' market. Genericism is the enemy of viral brands.",
