    "gap_description": "Your Strategy defines the purchase as 'The Pragmatist' (Smart Choice)—a rational decision based on value. However, the PDP reality delivers 'The Trend-Setter' (Statement)—a viral purchase driven by cultural relevance. You are selling a status symbol at a commodity price point.",
    "evidence": "[SELF-EXPRESSION] Strategy: 'The Smart Choice (2/5)' vs. Reality: 'The Statement (4/5)'",
    "why_matters": "You are leaving massive margin on the table. When a customer buys a 'Statement,' they are price-inelastic. By positioning it as a 'Smart Choice' (cheap), you undercut the premium 'Cool Factor' you have successfully generated on social media.",

    "gap_description": "Your Strategy aims for a 'Conversational' tone (4/5)—approachable but grounded. The PDP has drifted into full 'Slang' (5/5), relying heavily on internet-native phrases like 'Pro tip' and 'Say hello to.' You are crossing the line from relatable to performative.",
    "evidence": "[TONE OF VOICE] Formality Slider: Strategy 'Conversational (4/5)' vs. Reality 'Slang (5/5)'",
    "why_matters": "Slang ages faster than milk. While it resonates with Gen-Z today, it alienates the broader 'Masstige' demographic who want efficacy, not a meme. Over-indexing on slang risks making the brand feel juvenile rather than youthful.",
    "do_this_now": "Audit the A+ Content for 'internet speak.' Keep the energy high (Enthusiasm 4/5) but dial back the slang (Formality 5/5 -> 4/5). Ensure the product is described as a skincare solution first, and a 'bestie' find second."

On the PDP, this has swapped to 'The Caregiver' (15%), focusing on 'Soothing', 'Hypoallergenic', and safety. You promised a moral choice; you are delivering a medical one.",
    "evidence": "[ARCHETYPES MIX] Tertiary: Strategy 'The Innocent' vs. Reality 'The Caregiver'",
    "why_matters": "The Innocent drives loyalty through shared values (Sustainability). The Caregiver drives purchase through necessity (Sensitive Skin). By swapping them, you dilute the emotional brand equity in favor of functional utility, making you more replaceable by other 'gentle' brands.",

    "gap_description": "Your Key Selling Points score a healthy 90%, but the drift from 'The Users' (Strategy) to 'The Fans' (PDP) is risky. You are leaning heavily on viral fame (55k reviews, TikTok hits) to move units. Viral heat is not a permanent brand pillar.",
    "evidence": "[KEY SELLING POINTS] Validator: Strategy 'The Users (4/5)' vs. Reality 'The Fans (5/5)'",
    "why_matters": "When the algorithm changes or the next viral product drops, 'Fan' validation evaporates. A brand built on hype is fragile. You need to anchor validation back into the product experience itself, not just the social mania surrounding it.",
    "do_this_now": "Diversify the social proof. Mix the 'Viral Hit' messaging with 'Long-term Results' testimonials. Ensure 50% of the review highlights focus on skin health (efficacy) rather than obsession (hype)."

    "evidence": "[EMOTIONAL BENEFITS] Alignment: 100% | Opportunity: Push Anxiety Axis from Delight to Sanctuary",
    "why_matters": "Competitors sell lotion. You are selling a moment of peace. In a high-stress world, 'Sanctuary' commands a higher price and deeper loyalty than 'Delight.' You are selling the product short by treating it as a treat rather than a necessity for mental wellbeing.",
